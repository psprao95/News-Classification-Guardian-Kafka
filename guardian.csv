"Irish prime minister wrote heartfelt fan letter to Kylie Minogue, FOI reveals The Irish prime minister used official letterhead to write a fan letter to Kylie Minogue, freedom of information documents reveal. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar sent a handwritten message saying he was a “huge fan” of the Australian pop star, offering to meet her in person ahead of her Dublin concert in October last year. “Dear Kylie,” he wrote. “Just wanted to drop you a short note in advance of the concert in Dublin. I am really looking forward to it. Am a huge fan! “I understand you are staying in the Merrion hotel which is just across the street from my office in Government Buildings. If you like, I’d love to welcome you to Ireland personally.” The department of the Taoiseach twice blocked the freedom of information request from The Irish Mail on Sunday, before Varadkar consented to the information being made public. The department initially blocked the request because the letter was written “in a personal capacity” and did not “relate to matters arising in the course of the purpose of the Taoiseach’s functions as the head of government”. Sadly, the Australian pop star had to cancel the October concert mentioned in Varadkar’s letter, due to a throat infection. But Minogue personally called him to apologise, and finally met with the leader at a rescheduled concert in December. Varadkar then had to deny accusations he had received a free meal at the concert. Varadkar also made international headlines last month when he brought his partner to meet with US vice president Mike Pence, and spoke against homophobia and LGBT discrimination.",Music
"Naked Swedish police officer apprehends fugitive while visiting sauna An off-duty Swedish police officer successfully arrested a violent fugitive drug dealer while both men were naked in a Stockholm sauna, public broadcaster SVT has reported. The unnamed officer had just sat down when he spotted the wanted man, who had been on the run since receiving a prison sentence for assorted drugs offences and aggravated assault against a public official. “He never showed up to serve his sentence, so was naturally on a wanted list,” said Christoffer Bohman, deputy chief of police in the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby. “This officer was off duty, and by coincidence – and somewhat comically – both men recognised each other in the sauna.” Bohman praised the officer for his calm response to what could otherwise have become a particularly heated confrontation, saying the arrest was effected in a thoroughly professional and undramatic manner. “It’s obviously much easier to act when you have colleagues with you, plus all the right tools and equipment,” he said. “This was about as stripped-back and bare-bones an arrest as it is possible to make, in several senses of the term.” Bohman also paid tribute to the officer in a Facebook post, describing him as a “top colleague who kept a cool head even when things were hotting up to a potentially dangerous situation, and despite being on your day off and in a sauna.” The arrest was carried out “with due consideration to the best interests of all concerned”, he said, adding: “We are everywhere. Even if you do not see us, we are there.” The wanted criminal will now serve his sentence, Bohman said.",World news
"Millionaires in Australia are managing a tax bill of $0 The release of the latest taxation statistics by the Australian Taxation Office shows the top 10% of taxpayers paid their lowest share of tax since 2005-06 and that the number of millionaires avoiding tax continues to rise. The statistics also highlight the ongoing gender income gap, with new breakdowns of occupations revealing that men have a higher median salary than women in 90% of all occupations. The release of the annual taxation statistics by the ATO is a true delight for stats lovers. There is an absolute trove of information that can be gleaned from the 13.87 million taxation returns we filled out in 2016-17. The big-ticket item the data shows is that in 2016-17 a growing number of millionaires were able to avoid paying tax. Sixty-nine people who earned more than $1m in 2016-17 paid $0 in tax – an increase from 62 in 2015-16, and 48 in the year before that. How did they do it? Well let’s just say it helps to have a good accountant, and it helps to pay that person a lot of money. Of the 68 millionaires, 27 claimed a deduction from the cost of managing tax affairs totalling $16.4m. They also claimed a massive $149m in gifts or donations – which was a big jump on the $57.5m donated by non-tax paying millionaires in 2015-16, with the increase likely to have come via one very large benefactor. Should the ALP win office, these millionaires will be unable to get as much benefit from using accountants. The ALP intends to limit the amount you can deduct from the cost of managing your tax affairs to $3,000. This won’t affect many of us – more than 99% of us either do our own taxes or pay less than $2,500: But for those who earn more than $180,000, it can be very expensive to reduce your taxable income. Nearly 90% of those in 2016-17 with a total income of above $180,000 remained in the top tax bracket, and they pay on average just $1,429 to manage their tax affairs. Of the 694 who were able to get their taxable income down to within the $37,000 to $87,000 tax bracket, the cost was significantly more – an average of $18,618. But the big spending was done by those who were able to get their taxable income below the tax-free threshold of $18,200; they paid an average of $133,151: Such a policy of limiting the deduction to $3,000 might ensure millionaires and the like pay their fair share of tax and help increase the amount of tax paid by the wealthiest. In 2016-17, the top 10% of taxpayers – those with a taxable income above $126,635 (alas this is taxable income so excludes the millionaires who paid no tax) paid 44.5% of all income tax. That was the lowest amount for over a decade: One area also down this year was the number of people negative gearing. Just 9.4% of individuals recorded a rental loss in 2016-17 – the lowest since 2009-10: This is not due to people getting out of the rental market – quite the opposite. In 2016-17 a record 15.5% of individuals claimed a gross rental income. But falling interest rates make it tougher to negative gear as the cost of servicing your loan actually falls. But the tax stats do once again highlight just how exaggerated the benefits of negative gearing flow to the wealthy. Just on 3.5% of all individuals earned over $180,000 in total income, but they accounted for 8% of all negative gearers and claimed 15% of the total loss of money from rent: The tax stats also highlight the massive income gap between men and women. While women make up 49% of all taxpayers, only in the bottom two tax brackets do they represent more than this amount. The account for just 26% of those earning over $180,000: The situation is even worse when broken down according to occupations. Of the 1,165 different occupations that had both men and women work, just 124 had women earning a higher median salary or wage than their male counterparts. And mostly these were lower-paying occupations. Out of the 208 occupations with a median salary above $87,000, just two had women with a higher median salary than men – state governor (not the easiest of job to get!) and neurosurgeons (and when including other income besides salary, male neurosurgeons had a much higher median income). And yet of the 50 occupations with a median salary below the tax-free threshold, 26 had women with a higher median salary than the men. It means that while just 22% of all occupations have a median salary below $37,000, they account for nearly 70% of the occupations where women have a higher median salary than men: Tuesday’s budget will produce lots of talk about average income earners, help for taxpayers and fairness. But the latest tax statistics show that women and men are at very different levels when it comes to average and median incomes. Fairness is also tough to sustain when the ability to reduce the amount of tax you pay is skewed towards those who can either afford an expensive accountant or an equally expensive rental property.

"Soft Brexiters blame referendum supporters for Commons deadlock MPs backing a soft Brexit turned their fury on second referendum campaigners on Monday night, blaming MPs backing a people’s vote for parliament’s failure to reach a consensus. The former chancellor Ken Clarke said second referendum campaigners had scuppered the chances of his motion on a customs union, which lost by just three votes. Clarke rejected the suggestion from the Green party’s Caroline Lucas that a compromise motion of a customs union and a referendum would win support. “If you add the people’s vote to a motion like mine, you lose votes all over the place … vote for something you have no objection to as a fallback position,” he said. Referendum supporters immediately hit back at the criticism, pointing out that the vast majority of MPs had compromised and that at least four were absent for personal reasons. “Cooperation is needed, not competition, at this stage – and all of us fighting against a no-deal Brexit made that clear before these crucial votes,” one senior Labour MP said. “Parliament has come closer to a solution in seven hours than the PM has in two years.” Key backers of a second referendum, including the Independent Group (TIG), Liberal Democrats, and Labour referendum supporters such as Jo Stevens and Owen Smith, voted against Clarke’s motion, which was also opposed by Labour leave supporters. The SNP instructed its 35 MPs to abstain. The Lib Dem Norman Lamb, who had urged his party to back a compromise, said he was furious with the result. “I am so deeply distressed. I am ashamed to be a member of this parliament,” he said. “We have failed in our responsibility today. There has been far too much posturing and intransigence, including from my own party.” Lamb said he believed the lack of compromise had pushed the UK closer to a no-deal exit. “It may now be too late,” he said. “I don’t hold out much hope now. There is a very real chance we will crash out. We have failed twice now and failed because of people who broadly support a customs union not being willing to back it.” Stephen Kinnock, one of the key campaigners with Nick Boles for the common market 2.0 plan, or Norway-style Brexit, said he had been prepared to compromise by voting for the second referendum option. “It was therefore very disappointing to see that 33 colleagues who are campaigning for a referendum chose not to reciprocate,” he said. “It appears that some of us were acting in good faith and in a spirit of compromise whilst others were not.” TIG’s Anna Soubry said backers of a referendum had also tried to forge a compromise with soft Brexiters, but any efforts to draft a composite motion had been rejected. Soubry said she still hoped that a compromise to pair a soft Brexit with a referendum could be reached. “There is a way of getting this together. If you look at the figures, there is every chance on Wednesday we can find a compromise,” she said. Days of intensive horse-trading in parliament convinced the Labour front bench and the Scottish National party to back common market 2.0. Yet the motion still failed to reach a majority by 21 votes, coming behind a second referendum and a customs union, a motion that fell by just three votes. After the result, Boles resigned on the floor of the House of Commons, blaming his failure to convince his own party to compromise. Supporters of a soft Brexit or a second referendum acknowledged during the course of the day that they had not managed to convince anything like sufficient numbers of Conservatives to back a compromise option, with insufficient support for a stable majority to pass legislation for any compromise. One significant intervention came on Monday afternoon. The Tory MP Huw Merriman, a parliamentary aide to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, wrote a letter to all MPs on Monday urging them to back the Peter Kyle motion for a referendum, saying he had got to the point where he believed it was preferable to a customs union. “If, like me, you are not a supporter of this option, then I am appealing to you to consider the confirmatory vote option,” he wrote, though he said he sympathised with a constituent who compared the choice to “asking which leg he would like amputated”. Fifteen Tory MPs backed the motion for a second referendum. However, some MPs fear that Tories sympathetic to a second referendum have been spooked by the treatment of Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who backed a fresh public vote and lost a vote of no confidence at an angry local association meeting last week. “Tories saw the video of that meeting and are now thinking, ‘I don’t want any of that,’” one People’s Vote source said. MPs still believe Clarke’s motion for a customs union has a high chance of success should MPs bring back another round of indicative votes on Wednesday. However, the Labour MP Clive Lewis, a backer of a second referendum, said the cross-party coalition in favour of a softer Brexit would not hold for binding votes. “Although a customs union and common market 2.0 did well, they did so with the votes of MPs like me who would only support them in binding votes if they were then put to the people,” he said.",Politics
"The FCA’s supervision of LC&F is finally being investigated. About time too The London Capital &amp; Finance scandal, in which the now infamous investment firm collapsed owing £236m to 11,000 people, may be one of the worst regulatory failures on the watch of the Financial Conduct Authority, the body established in 2013 to do better than its derided predecessor. Now an independent investigation will be launched. About time too. The first half of the inquiry is the tamer element, at least from the FCA’s point of view, since it will ask whether the regulatory system itself is up to scratch. At least part of the answer must be no. LC&amp;F itself was regulated by the FCA from June 2016, but the actual “mini-bonds” marketed with enticing interest rates of up to 8% were unregulated. The scope for confusion among innocent retail investors is obvious. Better technical fixes may mean neon-lit warnings about the limitations of an FCA authorisation, or even pre-approval of marketing materials. But something clearly has to improve. Yet the core question is about the FCA itself. Even within a muddled system, should it have woken up earlier? Independent advisers have said they warned the regulator about LC&amp;F as early as November 2015. What did the FCA actually do between then and December 2018, when it finally ordered LC&amp;F to withdraw “misleading, unfair and unclear” marketing literature? Assets were frozen at that point, and the administrator has since reported on where investors’ “mini-bond” savings were going. It is an extraordinary tale of speculative property developments in the Dominican Republic, Faroe Islands oil adventures and helicopters. Then there is the separate question of how LC&amp;F’s products could ever have appeared, incorrectly, alongside the magic words “ISA eligible”. The worst part, though, is how long the LC&amp;F saga lasted. One can accept that even competent regulators will sometimes struggle to police every corner of the financial jungle. But, when outside professionals have sounded the alarm, the excuse for inaction had better be good. If the FCA has a sound explanation, it has yet to share it. The terms of reference for the inquiry have yet to be decided. Go for: as deep and wide as necessary. Big four accountancy firms face fees pressure “Audit can only be transparent and independent when it is fully priced. It will only be fully priced when it is no longer subsidised. Therefore, subsidies must end and audit must stand on its own two feet.” The business select committee’s succinct summary of the case for separating the audit and non-audit functions of the big firms is excellent. It addresses head-on the big four’s objection that audit fees would go though the roof under a ringfenced system. Yes, fees might increase, the MPs accept, but “letting prices rise if need be is a desirable development”. Quite right. A system in which non-audit fees subsidise audit work is almost bound to breed conflicts of interest. The audit partners can feel beholden to their non-audit colleagues, especially when individuals are being rewarded on a firm-wide basis. In the end, the quality of audit work deteriorates and willingness to deploy professional scepticism suffers. The MPs prefer full structural separation of big firms, as opposed to the less radical option of operational separation. There is a long way to go before that argument is won, but the report should at least encourage belief in the idea that independence is worth paying for. We’ve tried the lower-cost subsidised version of auditing, and results have been terrible for years. Thames Water changes tune after regulatory nudge It’s amazing what a firm regulatory prod can do. At the end of January, Thames Water sounded furious when told by Ofwat to “substantially rework and resubmit” its next five-year business plan. Two months later, the tune has changed. The company has re-examined its numbers and concluded it can indeed achieve more for less. It promises to reduce pollution by 30%, rather than the 18% originally proposed; flooding in homes and businesses will fall by 20%, not 15%; and so on. And it will be done on a five-year budget cut by £800m to £10.9bn. We’ll find out in July whether Ofwat is satisfied, which is not guaranteed since Thames is still only offering a £5 per customer cut in bills, versus others’ more generous pledges. But the regulator has clearly won the main argument about efficiency: Thames should have pushed itself harder in the first place. In one respect, though, the company probably has a point: most customers surely do care more about getting decent pipes and reservoirs for the 21st century than shaving a few quid off bills. Ofwat must triple-check spending assumptions, but there may be a basis for agreement this time.",Business
"Word 'empire' made accepting OBE difficult, says David Olusoga David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster, has said he was pleased to be awarded an OBE, while also feeling troubled by the brutal history of the British empire. Olusoga, a professor of history at the University of Manchester, has a Nigerian father. He said the honour’s links to Britain’s violent imperial past made it difficult to accept, but he was able to rationalise accepting the honour while recognising the “terrible, terrible episodes” in its history. “I don’t believe we should have this ledger book, this balancing-scales view of the empire,” Olusoga told the Radio Times. “Was it good? Was it bad? Should we feel pride? Should we feel shame? “I think we should look at the empire for what it was, this complicated, more-than-400-year story with terrible, terrible episodes. Using that word ‘empire’ does make it a difficult award to accept. But if you decline, then you should shut up about it and I had to ask myself the question – would I?” The Order of the British Empire, like all other official honours of the British state, is problematic for many people of minority descent because of its links to the systematic domination, racist violence and genocide employed by the British in Africa, America, Asia and Australasia from the 17th century onwards. When the poet Benjamin Zephaniah refused the same honour in 2003 for his services to literature, he said he got angry just to hear the word “empire”. He wrote in the Guardian: “It reminds me of slavery, it reminds me of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised.” “Benjamin Zephaniah OBE – no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire,” he said. “Whoever is behind this offer can never have read any of my work.” Olusoga, a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which publishes the Guardian, has written extensively on the the development of empire and the history of black people in Britain, including their involvement in the British military. He picked up his medal from the palace in January, when the Queen handed out her new year honours. He was cited for his services to history and community integration. In a Guardian article days later, he revealed that the “exhilarating and humbling news” of his award was tempered by the soul-searching over the “extractive, exploitative, racist and violent” nature of the empire. He accepted, he said, because he felt that it would be worse if no black or Asian Britons were honoured by the awards system, because “the contributions non-white people have made have long been under-recognised”. Olusoga’s recent comments on his OBE come days after Mohammed Mahmoud, imam at the Finsbury Park mosque, accepted the same award in recognition of his actions after the terror attack on worshippers there in 2017. Mahmoud, whose parents are Egyptian, also expressed reservations about the connotations of British colonialism, such as “massacres, subjugation and destruction of rich and proud cultures”. But he said he had accepted the honour as “recognition for everyone in my community”.",Politics
"Drugs before sex more common in UK than in Europe or US – study UK citizens are more likely than Europeans or those living in the US to have taken drugs such as MDMA and cocaine before sex during the last year, according to a new study. Researchers used data from the Global Drug Survey of roughly 22,000 people to find that 64% (4,719) of people surveyed from the UK had had sex having drunk alcohol, compared with 60% (1,296) from Europe and 55% (2064) from the US. Of those who took part in the study, the number who combined sex and cocaine was 13% from the UK (936) compared to 8% from Europe. Similarly, a higher number said they had had sex after MDMA, with 20% of those who participated in the survey from the UK saying they had done so against 15% from the US and Europe. The study’s lead author, Dr Will Lawn, noted that because the study was self-selecting, the proportion in the overall population was likely to be lower. The drugs most commonly used during sex across all countries were alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine, while GHB – which has been linked to chemsex parties, where participants take drugs with the specific aim of having sex afterwards – and MDMA were viewed as having the most significant effect on sexual experience. The findings were put together by academics at the University College London and the Global Drug Survey team and published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. They drew from a survey where people responded to online questions about which drugs they used when having sex, as well as how drugs affected their sexual experience. “To my knowledge no one has ever investigated country-related difference in how drugs are combined with sex, and this shows the UK may well be at greater risk of chemsex-related harm than other countries, something our country has to be mindful of,” said Dr Lawn. The British Medical Journal has called chemsex a “public health timebomb” because of the associated prevalence of risky sex. Lawn also noted that some drugs would be more popular in certain countries, leading to differences. “For a drug like mephedrone, there was a strong difference between the UK and the Eurozone because [the drug] was particularly popular in the UK but not so much other parts of the world,” he said. He said cannabis was more commonly used in the US in general and this correlated with a higher number of people using it during sex. Cannabis was the only drug in which the UK did not top the US and other countries, with 49% of people from the states combining it with sex compared with 36% in the UK. Lawn said that “differences between groups did emerge” in the study. Men who identified as homosexual were roughly 1.6 times more likely than heterosexual men to take drugs with the intention of enhancing their sexual experiences. They confirmed that GHB/GBL, mephedrone and methamphetamine are more commonly combined with sex by homosexual men than heterosexual men. Lawn said: “In summary, the overall message is that men and women of homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientation all use drugs with sex. We should not isolate that behaviour as something only men who have sex with men do, which is the stereotypical chemsex image. However, harm reduction messages about certain drugs should still be targeted at specific drugs to specific groups, given that the combination of sex with GHB/GBL, mephedrone and methamphetamine is more popular among gay men.” Professor Adam Winstock, the founder and director of the Global Drug Survey and a senior author, said: “Our study is by far the largest to date to investigate the relationships between sex and drugs. Previous studies have rarely compared men and women, and people of different sexual orientations. “Furthermore, by appreciating how different drugs affect sex we can tailor our harm reduction messages. These pragmatic messages can save lives.”",Society
"Council register of home-schooled children proposed Parents will be required to register home-educated children with their local authority under government proposals intended to prevent young people from disappearing off the radar. An estimated 60,000 children are thought to be educated at home – a figure that is rising by about a quarter each year. The register will for the first time enable authorities to see where children are if they are not in school and intervene more effectively if required. The proposals, which will be outlined by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, on Tuesday, are intended to address concerns about soaring numbers of children out of school, particularly those who have been “off-rolled” or are attending illegal schools. Although the move was welcomed by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, it is likely to infuriate many people in the home education community who are providing their children with a sound education and object in principle to state interference in family matters. The Department for Education (DfE) is hoping to offset some of their concerns by promising home-educating parents additional support, including teaching resources or help from their local authority to pay for exam costs. Home educator Edward Hardy warned, however, that the community would fight the plans every step of the way. “The register will not protect children from parents who are intent on harming their children. Instead, it will amount to a further step down the path of unwarranted intrusion into family life by the state,” he said. Under the proposals, which will be subject to a 12-week consultation, it will be parents’ responsibility to register their child if they are not being taught in a state-funded or registered independent school. The government says the register is not intended to crack down on home educators, but to protect vulnerable children who may remain hidden from the authorities and those in illegal schools where they could come under “dangerous influences”. As now, if a local authority has concerns that a child is not receiving a suitable education, they can use school attendance orders to compel parents to send their child to a registered school, which can escalate to a prosecution if a family fails to comply. Announcing the plans, Hinds said: “As a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain. “That’s why this register of children not in school is so important – not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes, but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar.” The Local Government Association, which represents councils, welcomed the register, but called on the government to go further and give local authorities the powers and funding to enter homes or other premises to check a child’s schooling. The children’s charity NSPCC said a register alone would not automatically safeguard children. “There must also be regular checks just like any other education setting to ensure that children are being properly looked after when they learn,” a spokesperson said. Head of Ofsted and chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman, said: “Ofsted has long had concerns about the increasing numbers of school-age children not attending a registered school, many of whom may not be receiving a high-quality education or being kept safe. “We are especially concerned about children ‘off-rolled’ from schools, and those in illegal schools. The new register will make it easier to detect and tackle these serious problems.” The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said: “It is vitally important that we know that all children are safe and that they are receiving the education they deserve to help them to succeed in life. The introduction of a register for children not in school is very welcome and something I been calling for. I am pleased these proposals also include support for families.”",UK news
"Big four accountancy firms should break up, say MPs Britain’s big four accountancy firms should face a full break-up to weaken their “stranglehold” on an audit market discredited by corporate failures including Carillion and BHS, MPs have suggested in a hard-hitting report. The business, energy and industrial strategy (Beis) committee said the competition watchdog – which is due to release its final recommendations for reform of the audit industry – should consider the break-up of the country’s biggest accountants by separating their audit and consulting arms. Between them, the four big players – KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY – conducted the audits at all but one of the UK’s 100 biggest listed companies last year. “The big four’s dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on,” Rachel Reeves MP, the Labour chair of the committee, said. “Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.” The committee suggested imposing market share caps on the big four and bringing in joint audits conducted by a big four player and a challenger firm. The latter proposal is already supported by the Competition and Markets Authority. Reeves said the big four were also often using their audit work as a route to “milking the cash-cow of consultancy business”. The CMA has already proposed splitting the audit and consulting at an operational level but has stopped short of recommending a full separation. But the Beis committee’s report, The Future of Audit, argued for a “full structural break-up” of the big four. A break-up would be more effective in “tackling conflicts of interest” and providing the “professional scepticism” needed to deliver high-quality audits, the committee said. “We must not wait for the next corporate collapse,” Reeves said. “Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension holders and the public expect. “Change is needed to deliver for investors, workers and the public. The big four may not like it, they may seek to undermine the case for reform, but vested interests should not be allowed to get in the way of positive change.” However, the British business lobby group, the CBI, accused MPs of being “heavy-handed” and warned that “rushing to simplistic” changes would damage the UK’s reputation. “The committee’s idea to force a break-up of the big four jumps the gun,” Josh Hardie, the CBI’s deputy director-general, said. “It puts forward a heavy-handed solution rather than waiting for the evidence of the reviews investigating the state of the current market and future vision for audits. “Businesses are aware there are problems with the audit market and it is a tough challenge to fix them. High-profile corporate failures have rightly prompted searching questions. But the UK’s position as a stable, evidence-based country is already under threat. So rushing to simplistic measures rather than following a clear, considered long-term approach will damage our reputation further.” PwC warned that breaking up the big four would weaken resilience, increase costs and damage the UK’s global competitiveness. “We recognise the need for reforms which will enhance audit quality; however, the report’s recommendation to break up the largest firms risks hampering, rather than enhancing it,” Hemione Hudson, PwCs head of assurance, said. “Arguing for ‘break-up’ sounds like action, but actually it will reduce quality, weaken resilience and distract attention from more practical steps to ensure auditing keeps pace with society’s expectations. “There are likely to be significant unintended consequences from breaking up the large professional services firms, with increased cost and disruption to the economy and businesses which would be damaging to the UK’s competitiveness.” A separate review, carried out by the Legal &amp; General chair, Sir John Kingman, will lead to the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), being abolished and replaced with the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. An FRC spokesperson said: “The FRC shares a number of the concerns expressed in the select committee report which are consistent with the evidence we submitted to its inquiry. Long-term fundamental changes to the regulation of audit form part of the implementation programme we are developing with Beis.” Liz Murrall, the director of stewardship and reporting at The Investment Association, which represents asset managers, welcomed the Beis commitee recommendations. “Investors rely on the quality and robustness of audits when making investment decisions, and a high-quality audit is vital to ensure that the markets have confidence in the information in a company’s annual report,” she said. “The recommendations outlined in today’s report are an important step in achieving this.”",Business
"Larger actors rarely get cast as romantic leads, says James Corden James Corden has said that “chubby” actors are routinely excluded from the casting for romantic roles because of an industry aversion to showing them falling in love or having sex. The Late Late Show host, 40, said that “fat” actors have to accept in film or on TV that “certainly no one ever finds you attractive”. Speaking to the actor David Tennant on his podcast, David Tennant Does a Podcast With, Corden said that overweight people are, at best, cast as the funny friend of someone who is “attractive”. He said that such characters “never really fall in love” and “never have sex”. Speaking of his breakthrough while he was performing in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys in 2004, Corden said: “I was in the play with seven other boys who were at a similar age and a similar place in our careers, and pretty much every day, three or four of these boys would come in with a massive film script under their arm.” For one role, “they were looking for two boys of 21 and 22 and [two others] got sent the script [for lead roles] and I got sent just two pages to play a newsagent at the start of this film,” he said. “I really felt like people were going, ‘We think you’re quite good. It’s just because of what you look like.’” Corden said that larger actors are often typecast. “You will be good friends with people who are attractive and will perhaps chip in with the odd joke every now and again,” he said. “As you get older, you’ll probably be a judge in something or you’ll be dropping off a television to a handsome person in a sitcom.” Corden’s beliefs are echoed by studies on the topic. American research has shown that the under-representation of overweight people on prime-time television has fuelled discriminatory attitudes in the general public.

"E-cigarettes do not normalise smoking for young people – study The sharp increase in the use of e-cigarettes has not led more British children to take up cigarettes or regard smoking as normal, the first study of its kind has shown. Some health experts and anti-smoking groups have expressed concern that the growth of e-cigarettes might normalise the idea of smoking for young people. But the study led by Cardiff University researchers suggests the number of teenagers who said they had tried smoking or thought it was acceptable to smoke has continued to fall despite the rise in e-cigarette use. The study, published in the journal Tobacco Control, examined data from England, Wales and Scotland, and found that from 1998 to 2015 the percentage of children aged between 13 and 15 who had smoked decreased from 60% to 19%, while regular smokers in the same age group fell from 19% to 5%. It also reported that the percentage of young people who reported that trying a cigarette was “OK” declined from 70% in 1999 to 27% in 2015. The report also points out that in the same period there was a fall in cannabis and alcohol use. The analysis, funded by the National Institute for Health Research and conducted in collaboration with academics from Edinburgh, Stirling, Glasgow and Bristol, focused on three national surveys canvassing the views of almost 250,000 young people. Dr Graham Moore, based at the Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement, said: “These findings suggest that fears over a resurgence in youth tobacco smoking because of the rise in e-cigarette use are largely unfounded to date. “The nature of e-cigarettes, and the landscape in which they are sold and used, continue to change rapidly, and we need to continue to keep a close eye on how they affect young people. However, this study demonstrates the success of public health efforts in reducing smoking among young people in the last 20 years and provides no evidence that e-cigarettes are reversing this.” E-cigarette experimentation is becoming more popular among young people who have not previously used tobacco, although regular use of e-cigarettes by young people remains rare, the report says. Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, added: “Teenagers across Great Britain were trying e-cigarettes during the period when they were unregulated, and recent data suggests that these trends have continued up to the present day. But the findings of this study show that youth tobacco smoking has nevertheless continued to decline.” The Welsh government was so concerned about the idea of e-cigarettes normalising smoking that in 2016, it tried to bring in legislation banning them from enclosed public places where children are likely to be present. Opponents claimed a ban could discourage smokers from switching to vaping to try to kick the habit, and the ban did not come into force. The tobacco control campaign group Ash Wales believes e-cigarettes have a crucial role to play in reducing smoking. The group’s CEO, Suzanne Cass, said: “We welcome the results of the study and hope this will strengthen the case for e-cigarettes to be considered a highly effective smoking cessation tool and a far safer alternative to smoking tobacco, rather than the first step to becoming a smoker.” Simon Clark, the director of the smokers’ group Forest, said: “The study shows there is nothing to fear from the growth of vaping. “The results support our view that government should ease restrictions on e-cigarette advertising. It’s time too for local authorities to lead by example and lift restrictions on the use of e-cigarettes in the workplace and other public areas. “Young people’s negative views on smoking also suggest the health risks are very well understood. Now they need to be taught about choice and personal responsibility so when they are adults they can make informed decisions without unnecessary state intervention.”",Society
"After this failure by MPs, Britain could now stumble into a pointless general election Until just after 10pm on April Fools’ Day, when John Bercow began to announce the results, it was still just about possible to persuade oneself that there might be an modestly uplifting ending to parliament’s long battle of Brexit. After a debate from which most Tory Brexiter MPs ostentatiously stayed away, it felt as if an all-party revolt of pro-European MPs might be about to drag Theresa May’s government unwillingly into a different kind of Brexit. But it was not to be. In the event, that effort has failed by just three votes. It probably might as well be three hundred. The might-have-beens are agonising. If just two MPs had voted differently, the outcome would have been reversed. If the Scottish nationalists, the Liberal Democrats, the Independent Group of MPs, or even the DUP – all of whom might in some circumstances plausibly have found their own reasons to support Kenneth Clarke’s customs union motion – had voted differently, then the Brexit landscape would have changed. But to imagine this is to indulge the politics of denial. None of these things happened. Parliament was not up to the task it had taken upon itself, of wresting control from a parlously weak and divided government. This narrowest of parliamentary defeats means that the House of Commons has confirmed for the fifth time — three goes on May’s deal and now two on MPs’ alternative motions — that it knows what it dislikes but not what it wants. The breakthrough has not happened. Instead, the Brexit landscape is as metaphorically churned, muddy and bleak as the western front. If the first rule of politics is to be able to count, then there is a grim reality in the numbers. May’s deal had inched to 286 votes last Friday, going down by 58 at the third try. Last night Clarke’s motion on a customs union clambered to 273, just nine more than it secured last week, but still not enough because of those decisive abstentions. Nick Boles’s common market 2.0 motion did much better than last week, with 261 as opposed to 188 the first time, but the abstainers were key here too. Peter Kyle’s confirmatory referendum motion did best of all, with 280 votes this time, but there is still a bridge too far between its supporters and their goal. In all these cases, the movement since last week was in the right direction. But the progress was desperately small. There is no momentum for the alternatives. So May can still claim that her deal has more support than any of them and will be tempted to try again with her own deal, for a fourth time, in the hope that the air has now gone out of the indicative vote process. The government chief whip, Julian Smith, may have told the BBC this week that the Tory party and the cabinet were an undisciplined lot. But the fact is that, for all their shambolic state, they are more in control of Brexit politics than the opposition parties. That’s not saying much, but it is May who comes away from this with marginally more viable options than her opponents, either on the hard Brexit right or the soft Brexit centre. The second day of indicative votes has shown that the opponents of Brexit don’t have the numbers to win on anything other than their determination to avoid a no-deal crash-out on 12 April. Parliament is not going to take control from May any time soon, or probably any time at all. But May is no longer in control either. She could roll the dice one last time. When ministers meet for a political cabinet on Tuesday, it increasingly looks as if, for want of anything else, they could take the country into a general election that is unlikely to solve anything. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",Opinion
"Conservative MP Nick Boles quits party after his soft Brexit plan fails Nick Boles, a former minister, quit the Conservatives on Monday night and walked out of the House of Commons chamber after his alternative plan for Brexit, which involved a Norway-style single market membership, was defeated for a second time. Boles’ voice cracked with emotion as he told the House of Commons that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP. Raising a point of order, he told parliament: “I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. “I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party.” While some on the opposition benches in the House of Commons applauded, one MP could be heard saying: “Oh Nick, don’t go, come on.” He had already resigned from his local Conservative party in Grantham and Stamford, where he was facing the prospect of deselection over his soft Brexit views. At the time, he told local members he was “not willing to do what would be necessary to restore a reasonable working relationship with a group of people whose values and views are so much at odds with my own”. It is the latest example of the Conservatives fracturing over Brexit, after Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen quit to campaign for a second referendum as part of the Independent Group, which is applying to become the new Change UK party. Boles said he would sit as a “independent progressive conservative” MP rather than join that group. The former planning minister was one of a quartet of Tory and Labour MPs who had worked for months on the common market 2.0 plan. Under the proposal – also known as “Norway-plus” – they wanted the UK to join the European Free Trade Area (Efta) and in that way regain membership of the EU single market. The government would have then sought to negotiate a customs arrangement to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland. Boles said last month that he had enjoyed working across the parties. “It’s been a real pleasure,” he said. “We don’t pretend not to be different. We don’t pretend not to have different philosophies, different priorities: and if anything we actually take some pleasure in finding out more about the others. It’s been a great experience, almost whatever the result.”",Politics
"Brexit indicative votes round 2: what happened and what next? What just happened? MPs were again unable to find a majority for any alternative Brexit deal in a series of indicative votes, as was the case in the first such votes last Wednesday. All four options were rejected, although one – a plan to leave with a permanent customs union – lost by just three votes. What were the results? The motion on a customs union, put forward by the Tory veteran Ken Clarke, lost by 273 votes in favour to 276 against. This was a slight improvement: the majority against the plan last week was six. A cross-party motion for a “common market 2.0” fell by 21 votes (261 to 282); a call for any final deal to be put to a referendum lost by 280 to 292; and a plan to give MPs the power to extend Brexit, or at least choose between no deal or revoking article 50, lost by 191 to 292. Were there any surprises? Yes and no. There had been no definitive expectations of any measure reaching a majority, but proponents of the customs union and common market 2.0 plans had been hopeful – the former because the margin of defeat had been so small last time, the latter because Labour changed its stance to whip in favour of the idea. What sunk the two close-run plans? In the customs union vote, joining the vast majority of Conservatives ticking the “no” box were a mix of people for whom the plan was not Brexity enough (the DUP, some Labour leavers) and those for whom it was too hard a departure (the Lib Dems, the Independent Group). Some remain-minded MPs abstained. The common market 2.0 plan suffered from a similar mix of opponents, and worries about the idea of not ending freedom of movement led 25 Labour MPs to defy the whip, mainly those in leave-voting areas. Another 33 Labour MPs abstained. Are MPs ever going to agree on anything? Who knows? The expectation had been that a looming no-deal departure – now due in 11 days’ time – would focus minds, build bonds and prompt compromises. But that has yet to happen. Focus will now turn to a possible third round of indicative votes, perhaps on Wednesday. Jeremy Corbyn, responding to the results in the Commons, called for this course of action, saying that if it was “good enough for the PM to have three chance at her deal”, then the same should go for MPs. Does this mean Theresa May’s plan is back on? It never went away, at least not as far as the government is concerned. Despite having put the deal (or in the last case, half the deal) to the Commons three times and losing by 230, 149 and 58 votes respectively, it seems likely MPs will get a fourth go later this week. Responding to the results, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said May’s plan was the only viable option left, given that the Commons had rejected leaving without a deal and cancelling Brexit. But with the DUP and Tory hardline Brexiters still adamant that they cannot back the plan, it still appears unlikely that it will pass. Who’s going to be most pleased by this? The MPs pushing the alternative plans are certainly not so chipper – the Tory Nick Boles resigned the party whip after his common market 2.0 plan was defeated, saying the government had refused to compromise. Theresa May could take grim pleasure from MPs trying to “seize control” of the Brexit process amid much criticism of her supposed incompetence and then proving just as unable to find a way through the weeds. She also now does not face the immediate choice that would have come from a positive vote for a softer Brexit: embrace this and lose half her cabinet or reject it and go for no deal, thus losing the other half. A couple of Brexit-minded MPs had even indicated that if May pushed for a customs union, they might vote with Labour on a no-confidence motion to bring down the government. But she still faces an intractable decision, a ticking clock, a mutinous party, an aghast British public and a frankly baffled EU. And it’s still only Monday. So what happens next? No timetable has yet been agreed. The cabinet meets on Tuesday morning for what will be a hugely important gathering, even by the standards of recent weeks and months. It seems we can then expect a new vote on May’s deal later in the week, and perhaps more indicative votes. Will this mean a long delay to Brexit, and UK participation in EU elections? Given parliament’s strong opposition to no deal, this is looking more likely. According to officials close to the Brexit negotiations in Brussels earlier in the day, the UK could still leave by 22 May – the set departure date if May’s deal is passed – if the Commons orders Downing Street to negotiate a customs union. However, the Commons has not done this.",Politics
"EU to announce further no-deal measures as MPs fail to end impasse Britain has been warned by Brussels that the country is staring into the “abyss” as the EU prepared to outline new no-deal measures in the wake of the latest Commons votes. EU sources said their focus had to be with dealing with the UK probably crashing out of the bloc in two weeks’ time, with patience increasingly wearing thin in the EU’s capitals. “All we can do is sort our house out,” one EU diplomat said. “But the failure to even find a small majority for any solution offers little indication that there is an orderly way out of this.” Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the last stage of the indicative vote process, to be held on Wednesday, offered the last hope of avoiding a no-deal. MPs plan to bring back a smaller number of proposals to the Commons in the hope that a compromise position can be found. He said: “The House of Commons again votes against all options. A hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable. On Wednesday, the UK has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.” Before the vote, EU officials had said Britain would be on track to leave the EU by 22 May if the Commons ordered Downing Street to negotiate a customs union. The desire to negotiate an ambitious customs deal could be swiftly written into the political declaration and formally signed off at the EU leaders’ summit on 10 April. But the customs union proposal, tabled by the former chancellor Ken Clarke, lost by three votes on Monday night. It was one of four proposals, along with the second referendum, the common market 2.0 proposal and revocation of article 50, that failed to achieve a majority. Speaking in Berlin earlier in the day, Jean-Claude Juncker had called for MPs to coalesce around a post-Brexit vision, and hinted at the danger that the EU’s patience was being stretched. The European commission president said: “We now know what the British gov does not want but we still don’t know what they do want. In comparison to the British parliament, a sphinx is an open book. We need to get the sphinx speaking. We’ve had enough of the silence.” Juncker, who described David Cameron as “one of the biggest destroyers in the modern era” for his role in the referendum, went on: “If the British have not left by the 12 April and there will be a delay, then they have to take part in the elections. Whether I wish for this to happen or not is another matter. I wish we could find an agreement with the Brits by 12 April so this question wouldn’t need to be asked.” The EU has already published a series of time-limited contingency measures, including legislation to keep flights in the air and road haulage routes open in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Further details on how the Irish border will be kept open are expected along with other measures designed to protect EU interests after a cliff-edge Brexit on 12 April. Senior EU sources said it would still be possible for the UK to leave by 22 May if the prime minister’s deal or one including a customs union were backed this week by MPs. Earlier, Verhofstadt had described a vote in favour of a customs union as “really the best thing that could happen”. He said: “That new political statement can then be approved at a European summit on 10 April and then we will give the British the opportunity to formalise it in English legislation by 22 May.” Verhofstadt’s optimism was not matched in all the EU’s capitals, given the British prime minister’s previous rejection of a customs union. In a speech on Saturday, Germany’s EU minister, Michael Roth, told an audience in Berlin: “Brexit is a big shitshow. I say that now very undiplomatically,” and added that “90%” of the British cabinet had “no idea how workers think, live, work and behave”. Labour backing for the idea of a customs union includes the condition that there is a British say in the EU’s trade policy. Brussels would probably seek to avoid a row on this issue ahead of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration finally being ratified by the Commons. But one EU official close to the negotiations admitted the UK would face stiff opposition to anything more than a symbolic consultative role.“When you consider EU trade deals are mixed agreements, there are the member states’ views, the European commission, and the voice of the European parliament,” the official said. “What can you do with a third country? Not much.”",Politics
"Gareth Southgate the statesman can inspire golfers and politicians alike Everyone loves Matt “Kooch” Kuchar, right? The American golfer has cherry‑cheeked and boy-smiled his way around the great courses of the world for years, the affectionate hooting of his fans a harmless counterpoint to the sometimes po-faced mien of the sport. Except “Kooch” is no innocent schoolboy. He is 40 years old and as tough a customer as there is in golf. At the World Match Play in Texas on Saturday, he got properly hard. After missing an eight-footer on the 7th hole that would have drawn him level, Sergio García assumed Kuchar would concede the “gimme” so back-tapped from a couple of inches, only to see the ball dribble past the hole. According to the PGA Tour: “Kuchar told the official he wanted to give García the putt, but that cannot be done retroactively.” Dumb all round, or what? Three holes later, a still-fuming García turned to Kuchar as they walked down the fairway and said: “I was at fault, but if it was me I’d have given you the putt at the next hole.” Kuchar couldn’t (it was a five-footer at the 8th) and didn’t. Kuchar held off a rousing fightback by the Spaniard and went on to lose in the final on Sunday against Kevin Kisner. The incident divided the game, as these nit-picking scenarios tend to do. García has previous. He was disqualified last month after bashing up some greens and bunkers in Saudi Arabia. Kuchar has had his moments, too. Last November in Cancun, he took a dig at everybody’s sense of fair play when he paid the experienced local caddie David Giral Ortiz $5,000 after the hard-up bag-carrier had helped him to victory around an unfamiliar course that was worth $1.296m to the rich American. Kuchar’s immediate response was: “For a guy who makes $200 a day, a $5,000 week is a really big week.” Social media howled him down and, three months later, he apologised and paid Ortiz $50,000. But he’d opened up his hard heart to the world. All of which will pale into insignificance if Rick Reilly’s latest book, Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, lives up to advance publicity. In one incident the US president allegedly threw a celebrity opponent’s ball from the green 50 feet into a bunker. Golfers have their own code of behaviour, but it has parameters. Rory McIlroy (who has played with Trump) says of “gimmes” for instance: “You might give your opponent a couple of three-footers early on and then make them putt them. Anything inside two feet I would give.” Bubba Watson, speaking before Saturday’s bust-up, revealed on Sky his rules for conceding a putt. “If I don’t like ’em,” he said, holding up three inches of tape, “it’s somewhere in around there. If I do like ’em, we don’t have enough [tape].” He added: “If they hit a quality chip shot, if they hit an unbelievable shot out of the trees, I might give ’em putts, just to show respect. But, at the same time the first hole is a little bit different to the 18th hole. There’s definitely a lot more love on the front nine than there is on the back nine.” It’s doubtful there’ll be much love between Kuchar and García at the Masters in a fortnight. Enmity in golf lingers, as between Nick Faldo and Greg Norman for many years. It’s a jungle out there on those clipped lawns. Few sports depend on etiquette like golf does. Football, though, can be a zoo. Which is why it might be time to start loving the England team again. There’s much to love, or at least admire until the morning. They are young, keen, talented and have a waistcoated manager so Dudley Do-Right he might have walked out of a comic. Gareth Southgate is to football what Martin Johnson was to the England rugby union team who won the World Cup in 2003: a leader of few words and much integrity. There was never anything flash about the angular defender and midfielder who had enough football talent to play 57 times for his country and more than 500 times for a handful of decent clubs. He was, in a nice way, unremarkable. He has blossomed as a person since his elevation to England manager, though, and he showed more statesmanship in one interview last week than the entire cabinet have managed in the past three years. It is obvious Southgate owns the locker room. Led by the majestic Raheem Sterling – ear cocked to the bigots after scoring – Danny Rose and young Callum Hudson-Odoi supported the gaffer’s measured condemnation of the racism that marred England’s win in Montenegro. They spoke not to Fifa or Uefa or the Football Association or the Premier League. Southgate went over the heads of the suits to a wider audience, home and abroad, who are the source of the problem. Some of those miscreants had representatives in the pro-Brexit, Leave Means Leave march in Westminster on Friday evening, spitting mindless invective at authority when they crowded around the gates of 10 Downing Street. They’re from the same tribe. Southgate and the players have been listening to similar bile for years. The last prominent athlete to enter the Westminster web of intrigue, Sebastian Coe, ran out of track and was pensioned off to the graveyard of red leather and ermine. But a mischievous thought recurs: what if Southgate one day became prime minister? We could do worse. Perhaps he could persuade some of the vocal mob to think again about their racism. Maybe some of the well-spoken hooligans inside the mother of all parliaments would learn something, too, from the gaffer’s direct and simple words. Southgate did not go to Eton – or even Winchester. He went to Hazelwick Comprehensive in Crawley New Town. When he picked out the artless thuggery that has plagued sport – and society – for decades, he did not need to wave a union flag to get his message across, like Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson. He was imbued with common sense, a commodity for which this country once was highly regarded.",Football
"Liverpool must win every game to grab title from City, says Sadio Mané Sadio Mané has said Liverpool are confident of winning every game until the end of the season and will have to do so to wrestle the Premier League title from Manchester City. Liverpool lead the champions by two points with six games remaining, albeit with City having a game in hand, after producing another dramatic late winner to defeat Tottenham on Sunday. Jürgen Klopp’s team visit Southampton on Friday with a belief they can overcome every test, according to Mané, who says the leaders require a flawless finish to the campaign to hold off Pep Guardiola’s side. The Senegal striker said: “That [belief] is what makes you more motivated and makes everyone say: ‘Let’s go, we can do it’, so I think it’s important. This is a very, very good sign and I think everything is possible, so let’s do it and win it. To be honest I think we need to win all of the games, even if it will not be easy. We still can win every game because we are a good team and we play very well.” Mané admits Liverpool must improve on their second-half display against Spurs to maintain pressure on City. “Sometimes it’s difficult after the international break because we only had two or three sessions together. Now we are back and we start with a win, I think it’s very important. We have three or four more days to train together so be like before and go again.” Andy Robertson, meanwhile, believes the defeat of Spurs demonstrated the heart and attitude that has propelled Liverpool throughout the title race and will push them on for the final games of the campaign. Liverpool replaced Manchester City at the top of the table on Sunday courtesy of Toby Alderweireld’s late own goal at Anfield. It was the third time this season that Klopp’s team have claimed victory in the 90th minute –more than any other Premier League side – and cleared arguably their toughest remaining assignment in pursuit of a first league title since 1990. Robertson admitted that luck was on Liverpool’s side against Spurs, who were the stronger team in the second half at Anfield. But he says the leaders’ habit of winning late is evidence of the indefatigable spirit within Klopp’s squad and no fluke. The Liverpool left-back, once again outstanding on Sunday, said: “I think it comes from the whole squad having the right attitude and belief that we are good enough to win any game. We knew Tottenham were playing well in the second half but we still believed we were better and could go on and win the game. “We know we’ve got the energy and we know we’ve got the heart to go right until the end in every single game. Our fitness levels are the best they should be at this point of the season so we know we can go right to the end. But sometimes you just need that wee bit of luck and we got it. “Even when we were going through the tough times in the second half, we still believed we were going to win the game and that’s the mentality we have. It maybe didn’t look likely at times but three points and looking at the league table is all that matters. Performances don’t really matter at this point of the season as long as we win.” Klopp admitted the manner of Liverpool’s dramatic victory on Sunday would have a greater impact on his players than a 5-0 stroll, and Robertson said: “Of course we’re all buzzing but only time will tell if it can give us that. I don’t think we’re lacking a spark but it can give us a real good push right to the end of this season now for six games. But we need to keep going like that and we need to play better than we probably did, especially in the second half.” Robertson’s peach of a cross for Roberto Firmino’s opening goal was his ninth assist of the Premier League season, the most by any Liverpool defender this term. “It’s a nice feeling,” the Scotland captain said. “But I won’t enjoy that until the end of the season because I want nine to become 10, 10 to become 11, and that’s the attitude I want to keep producing and hopefully get more assists and maybe pitch in with a goal or two – but that doesn’t look likely! I’m just happy to help create goals or score goals and this season I’ve put in some good crosses and the quality has been there but I just need more and six games to go hopefully I can get a couple more.” Virgil van Dijk, meanwhile, is expected to be fit to face former club Southampton at St Mary’s Stadium on Friday. The influential defender hurt his ankle when defending Moussa Sissoko’s late charge at Anfield and required an ice pack after the game. He is not believed to have suffered serious damage, however, and should be back in training before the game.",Football

"Solskjær confident Paul Pogba will stay at Manchester United after meeting Ole Gunnar Solskjær has revealed he had a meeting with Paul Pogba regarding the Frenchman’s future and is confident the 26-year-old will stay at the club beyond the summer. The conversation between the two came after Pogba had praised Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane, the Spanish club’s manager, during the international week. At the weekend Zidane admitted he liked Pogba “a lot”. Yet Solskjær is confident Pogba wishes to stay at United for the foreseeable future. “No, [those comments don’t] really concern me because my thought of action then is to sit down and speak to Paul and I’ve had my chat with Paul and we’re fine,” the Norwegian said. “He’s going to do his utmost here because he knows I’m very fond of him as a player and a person and he is important for us. There is no issue.” “I don’t like to talk about other teams’ players, of course, but this is another challenge with international breaks. Players are available all the time [to the media] as well and it’s a different environment, a general talk. Paul is a very nice and polite man who answered a general question about Zidane, who is an icon in France and a fantastic manager. He used to be a fantastic player and he’s just politely answered that question. But Paul’s happy here, he’s going to be a big part [here]. I’ve said before you like to build your team round him and that hasn’t changed at all.” United plan to appoint a technical director (a director of football in all but name) before the end of the summer and Solskjær said he will embrace this. “Football has changed and the structure at football clubs has changed,” the 46-year-old said. “Me and Ed [Woodward, executive vice-chairman] and Joel [Glazer, co-chairman], for that matter, are looking to how can this club be run as smoothly and as well as possible. I’ve got an input in most of the things now [he is the permanent coach] and, I’ve got to say, the communication between me, Ed and the owners is very good. We discuss different names, though of course I am not the one who decides. “So we’ll see what the club will end up with and I’m happy discussing football with knowledgeable people in the right positions anyway. That’s the way football goes - a manager can’t do as much as he used to do when my gaffer [Sir Alex Ferguson] started [in 1986]. I think the demands of football nowadays mean you’ve got to split responsibilities.” It is understood United have met several potential candidates for the post though, given the appointment requires a fundamental grasp of the club’s culture, the search is continuing. The role is an overarching one with responsibility for the first team and the long-term direction of the academy. Part of the remit is the ability to identify a teenage talent who could be loaned to a club United have a development relationship with and such strategic links are being explored. While the removal of José Mourinho, who was opposed to the position, has made securing a technical director smoother, both Solskjær and the recruitment department have a veto: both have to agree on any prospective candidate. Last summer the recruitment department vetoed Mourinho when he identified centre-backs he wanted. This may have caused the Portuguese’s subsequent public disquiet regarding the failure to buy one. Leicester City’s Harry Maguire and Bayern Munich’s Jérôme Boateng were two players Mourinho suggested. United travel to Wolves for Tuesday night’s 32nd Premier League game of the season and the Norwegian believes that, if his side can claim 15 points from the last available 21, then a Champions League berth can be attained. After Wolves United’s last matches are West Ham United (at home), Everton (away), Manchester City and Chelsea (h), Huddersfield Town (a) and Cardiff City (h). Solskjær said: “Everyone knows now, if we do our jobs, say 15 points then in the last seven games, we’ll be in the Champions League next year. I don’t think I have to remind them [the players] of that [what’s at stake].”",Football

I can feel the difference from last season. Now we may go to the Champions League. Me and Pierre are important for the team, like other players. Auba has helped me score many goals and I try to do the same. Why not go to the Champions League? I would like to score a lot of goals away. But if at the end we win it is the most important thing. We are more confident this season and everybody knows what we have to do.” A hearty cheer greets the final whistle. It was an entirely forgettable game, but Arsenal were deserved winners against an insipid Newcastle side, goals from Aaron Ramsey and Alexandre Lacazette enough to take them up to third with seven games left. They’re two points above Tottenham and Manchester United and three above Chelsea. Champions League qualification is in their hands. That’s your lot. 90 min+3: Mkhitaryan’s deflected shot goes over. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 89 min: The locals are amusing themselves with a few chants about Tottenham now. It’s been a while since Arsenal looked down on their north London rivals. 86 min: Maitland-Niles surges down the right and slides a low ball into the middle, where Aubameyang just fails to connect. Newcastle have pretty much given up now. Arsenal win a corner. Lacazette and Dubravka challenge for it and the ball ends up in Newcastle’s net, only for Anthony Taylor to disallow the goal for handball. To be fair, it did go in off someone’s hand. It’s just that it was Dubravka, who’s wearing a pair of goalkeeper’s gloves, got the final touch. Oh dear. 84 min: Henrikh Mkhitaryan replaces Mesut Ozil, who had a decent game. This is so simple, quick link-up play between Arsenal’s strikers too much for Newcastle to handle. Alexandre Lacazette starts the attack with a lofted prod to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. It isn’t the best pass - I doubt he meant to put it into the air - but Aubamayeng improvises with a deft header to send Lacazette through on goal. From there, it’s inevitable. Dubravka comes off his line and that gives Lacazette the chance to beat him with a well-judged lob. That should be that. Arsenal are heading third. 80 min: Diame uses his strength to make room on the left and dig out a cross. His ball doesn’t reach Rondon, though. Moments later Ki has a dig from 25 yards. Leno isn’t too worried as he watches the shot fly over. 77 min: Newcastle make their final change, Muto on for Ayoze Perez, who’s barely had a touch. 75 min: Kenedy replaces the anonymous Matt Ritchie. 73 min: The ball breaks to Ozil in midfield. He slips a stunning, curved pass through to Aubameyang, who shoots from an angle. Dubravka makes the save. 72 min: Kolasinac is booked for dissent. 71 min: Diame’s booked. This is drab stuff. All very bitty, neither team doing much of note, but Arsenal are doing just enough. 67 min: Newcastle make their first change, Isaac Hayden replaced by Ki, while Arsenal have brought on Mohamed Elneny for Aaron Ramsey. 66 min: Now Ramsey has gone down with an injury. His evening could be over - he’s already taken off the captain’s armband. 64 min: An Arsenal corner on the left. Ozil swings it in, Sokratis heads over. Moments earlier they’d appealed for a penalty, claiming that Dummett had handled when Lacazette burst clear. Nothing doing. 63 min: Newcastle have had 24% possession in the second half, which probably isn’t going to do much for their hopes of an equaliser. 61 min: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang replaces Alex Iwobi. 59 min: Monreal, lunging to win the ball, catches Almiron with his studs showing. Almiron stays down for a while. Monreal’s booked despite getting the ball. He’s very annoyed. But he wasn’t in control when he went to ground. 57 min: There’s no hint of a Newcastle equaliser. The game is being played in their half. It’s been fairly dull since half-time. Pierre-Emerick Aubamayeng is going to be on soon for Arsenal. He’s receiving some last-minute instructions from Unai Emery. 55 min: Lacazette dummies it through to Ozil, clear on the left, but the angle’s too tight and his dink over the advancing Dubravka. Maitland-Niles has recovered, by the way, and is soldiering on for now. 52 min: Maitland-Niles has gone down clutching his right knee. ACTIVATE CARL JENKINSON. 48 min: Almiron breaks down the left and looks for Rondon in the middle. Mustafi clears. 46 min: Arsenal get the second half underway. ... nothing happens. That’s the first half done with, then. Arsenal head in a goal to the good thanks to a smart finish from Aaron Ramsey. The hosts are comfortable at the moment and are 45 minutes away from rising into third place. This looks like a formality. Unless Newcastle are capable of perking up. 45 min+1: Arsenal mount one last attack, Ramsey slipping a pass through to Ozil. The German’s forced wide and he turns the ball back to Kolasinac. It ends up with Lacazette, who swivels and rams a shot past Dubravka - who’s grateful to see Ritchie save him with a heroic header off the line! What a clearance! Arsenal have a corner. From which... 45 min: There will be one added minute. 43 min: “Does Ramsey look very good now because he’s leaving or he’s actually just quite good and Arsenal are going to regret it?” says Zach Neeley. The latter. 40 min: Arsenal are beginning to enjoy themselves. Ozil and Iwobi delight the crowd with a lovely series of flicks and tricks on the left, before the ball comes to the overlapping Kolasinac, whose driven cross just evades Ozil at the near post. Dubravka is grateful to claim it. Newcastle could do with half-time. 38 min: Arsenal are threatening to double their lead. Lacazette almost bursts through. Ramsey’s shot is charged down. The ball comes to Ozil on the right. He dinks a cross to the far post, where Kolasinac heads at Dubravka. He’s offside, though. 35 min: Almiron isn’t in the game. Newcastle need Almiron in the game. 31 min: Newcastle are on the hunt for an equaliser straight away, Rondon bullying the lumbering Sokratis on the left, and rumbling into the area. He’s through on goal now. Yet he’s off balance as he shoots and Leno is able to push wide at his near post. The corner comes to nothing. It’s Arsenal’s first shot on target, but they won’t care, especially as it was a fine piece of play that pulled Newcastle open. Aaron Ramsey’s flick freed Lacazette, who was clear in the area. Lacazette’s control was poor but it bounced off the covering Yedlin and fell to Ramsey, who swept a low shot inside the left post with his left foot. The Welshman, captain for the night, isn’t going to have this one ruled out. Arsenal have a deserved lead. This one counts! 28 min: Lejeune launches a searching, straight ball over the top, and it completely catches Arsenal out. Sokratis and Mustafi have both dozed off and they’re immensely fortunate that Rondon can’t bring the ball down. 26 min: “The real question today is why the club that became famous in the 90s for adapting healthy diets now has such a large-waisted mascot?” Justin Kavanagh. “Never mind Brexit, fourth-place races, and other such trivialities, this is a question that needs answering Jacob.” 25 min: Iwobi crosses from the left. Lacazette, who’d given the seething Ritchie a little shove moments before the ball came in, flicks a header harmlessly wide. Dubravka hasn’t made a save yet. Good old Rafa. 21 min: Maitland-Niles wins a corner for Arsenal on the right. Iwobi and Ozil take it short. Ozil’s poor cross is cleared by Perez. 20 min: “Please don’t stress us out like that, could mean anything,” Zach Neeley says. “No more news please.” 18 min: Are you all watching the news? 17 min: Kolasinac’s deflected low cross fizzes straight through to Dubravka. 14 min: It felt pretty needless from Sokratis. It’s doubtful that Lejeune would have been able to leap high enough to stop the ball reaching Ramsey, whose run went untracked by Newcastle’s defence. It’s a big let-off for the visitors, albeit probably the right call from the referee to chalk off the goal. 13 min: Ozil sends the corner to the near post, it’s flicked on to the far by Kolasinac and Aaron Ramsey arrives unmarked to volley past Dubravka! Goal! Ramsey wheels away in celebration - but his joy is shortlived! Anthony Taylor’s blown his whistle and awarded a Newcastle free-kick after seeing Sokratis tug Lejeune’s shirt in the middle! Who needs VAR, eh? 12 min: A long ball over the top picks out Lacazette, who’s onside. He ends up winning Arsenal’s first corner. Ozil will take it from the left. 9 min: Diame nips in to rob Guendouzi, who responds by pulling the Newcastle midfielder down. Guendouzi, an amusingly snide player at times, especially for one so young, is lucky not to pick up a booking, 7 min: It’s been a fairly low-key start, with neither side stringing much together. Newcastle are not going to be expansive. 4 min: Maitland-Niles has a saunter down the right. And falls over. Not part of the plan. Moments later Mustafi launches in two-footed to win the ball off Almiron. He’s lucky not to catch the Paraguayan, else that could easily have been an early bath. 3 min: Arsenal are helping themselves to plenty of early possession, with Newcastle content to sit off. The visitors have lined up with a back five and could be tough to break down. Peep! Newcastle, in black and white stripes, get the ball rolling. They’re kicking from right to left in the first half and their fans are making plenty of noise. In the home end, meanwhile, there are a fair few red seats. Here come the teams! Football’s on the way. Let’s hope both goalkeepers have been studying Hugo Lloris training videos. Rafael Benitez speaks! “They are doing well but we come here with confidence. We will try to do something. You have to be focused and concentrated because they have players who can make the difference.” Unai Emery speaks! “Our focus is on finding our best performance. Our challenge is to continue winning here. We need a lot of respect for every team. Each match is very difficult and they are in a good moment. They are very organised and Rafa Benitez has big experience. We want to improve. We want to show good spirit to get third place.” Newcastle will have ways of hurting Arsenal here. They have one of the best defences outside the top six, as you’d expect of a Rafa Benitez side, and Miguel Almiron has given their attack a bit more zest since his January arrival. With one defeat in their last six, they travel to north London in a confident mood. On the other hand they haven’t won away since 15 December. In fact they have two away wins this season: Burnley and Huddersfield, and have lost their last six games at the Emirates. Arsenal: Leno; Mustafi, Sokratis, Monreal; Maitland-Niles, Ramsey, Guendouzi, Kolasinac; Iwobi, Ozil; Lacazette. Subs: Cech, Jenkinson, Elneny, Suarez, Nketiah, Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang. Newcastle: Dubravka; Lascelles, Lejeune, Dummett; Yedlin, Hayden, Diame, Ritchie; Perez, Rondon, Almiron. Subs: Darlow, Fernandez, Kenedy, Ki, Manquillo, Shelvey, Muto. Referee: Anthony Taylor. Hello. Compared to how they were feeling a year ago, things are actually going pretty well for Arsenal. The supporters are no longer on the brink of civil war, there isn’t a furious debate about the manager every single minute of every single day and it is even possible to detect signs of a team heading in the right direction. Unai Emery’s first season since replacing that professorial French chap hasn’t been without its disappointments, such as an early exit from the FA Cup and a few dodgy away performances in the league, but the Spaniard’s team are in the last eight of the Europa League and, as it stands, a first top-four finish since 2016 is theirs to lose. Not too shabby, all considering. A win here will lift Arsenal up to third, two points above Tottenham and Manchester United and three above Chelsea with SEVEN games to play, and the good news is that they haven’t made a habit of losing at home to teams like Newcastle under Emery. Only Liverpool, Manchester City and Wolves have taken points from the Emirates this season. Otherwise Arsenal have been dominant at home, sweeping stragglers and strugglers aside and even giving their rivals for in the race to qualify for the Champions League a good shoeing, and that makes it difficult to see them experiencing much trouble against Newcastle. Rafael Benitez’s side, seven points clear of the bottom three and drifting in 14th place, will have their work cut out containing Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. In Unai we trust, then. Sort of. Before everyone gets too excited, let’s not forget that five of Arsenal’s seven league games are away from home. They’ve only won once on the road in 2019, and that was against Huddersfield, so it doesn’t really count. Their travel sickness could yet be their undoing, while a European quarter-final with Napoli will also push them to the limit. For now, however, the mood is optimistic. A seventh consecutive home win is there for the taking. A place in the top four is theirs to snatch. It’s in their hands! In fact, you could even say that it’s ... up for grabs now!

"The Case Against Adnan Syed review – Serial should not have been televised ‘Do love and remember me for ever,” Hae Min Lee writes in her diary. Hers is a grim fame. In early 1999, Lee was strangled and buried in a shallow grave in Baltimore. Two decades later, she continues to be the subject of what has become a true-crime franchise, brought to the world’s attention by the success of the podcast Serial. The Case Against Adnan Syed (Sky Atlantic) is the latest instalment in the story of her murder. Syed was a teenager when he was convicted of the murder of his ex-girlfriend in 2000, although he has always said he is innocent. Has The Case Against Adnan Syed got any more to add? Its makers say it does, “presenting new discoveries as well as groundbreaking revelations that challenge the state’s case”. But those are promised later in this four-part series. Much of the first episode, rightly, is focused on the young woman who has seemed incidental in the attempt to discover whether or not Syed has been the victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice. If you were gripped by Serial (I was), it’s quite a shock to see Lee on a video clip of a local news item, talking about her lacrosse team, very alive and human, and not just an off-stage player on online forums dedicated to this case. One friend describes her as “goofy”; another talks about her passion. There is something desperately sad about the gulf between the interviews with these grownup, self-aware women and the gauche journal entries of their friend who would never join them. Anyone who kept a diary as a teenager will recognise the heady drama – mortifying, years later – that can be created with the liberal use of exclamation marks and some scribbled hearts. Her words are brought to life with dreamy animated sequences. Lee and Syed are reimagined walking arm in arm through idyllic woodland. The picture that emerges is that age-old one of young lovers, kept apart by their families – in this case, their controlling, traditional, immigrant parents. Any hints that all may not have well between them – Lee writes about their breakup: “Apparently you don’t respect me enough to accept my decision” – are not interrogated. “Teenagers are all over the place,” says her friend. Lee is cast as a spirited young woman, constrained by the cultural expectations of her family. “That was her household and she didn’t really have a choice to exist outside of that,” remembers her friend Debbie. The (brief) examination of the heritage of Lee and Syed’s families – Korean and Pakistani – and what that means in the US, brings another layer to the story. It is skilfully created, and mostly empathetically told by the director Amy Berg. And yet it’s still uncomfortable to watch. Another potential “suspect” is raised – Don Clinedinst, Lee’s boyfriend at the time – essentially because his alibi came from his mother. “The failure to investigate Don more thoroughly just really stands out as a major mistake,” says one of the private investigators hired for the documentary. In a story with so many obsessive sleuths invested, it seems irresponsible for a TV show to swing such a spotlight on to people. “Most people don’t have the resources you do to track me down,” Clinedinst tells the filmmakers, which almost sounds like a challenge. On Reddit, there are already people posting: “This guy sounds guilty” (the series started in the US last month). Its sympathy for Syed is clear, which is not to say that it’s misplaced. But a more sceptical approach could have differentiated it from the podcast and been more enlightening. “My prayers are not just that Adnan is exonerated but that God brings the truth to light,” says lawyer and family friend, Rabia Chaudry, who is also a producer on this show (and the catalyst for Serial). She cannot conceive of a possibility that the truth may not result in Syed getting released. Syed had been granted a new trial, but a few weeks ago, that decision was reversed. One day we may know if he has been an innocent victim, and the worth of a documentary like this – and its promised discoveries, reportedly in episode four, if they go anywhere – might only be judged in hindsight. In the meantime, its retreading of old ground only adds to the confusion. For all its attempts to humanise Lee, her family remained unwilling to take part (they have always believed in Syed’s guilt). I don’t blame them for their reluctance. Was it necessary to show photographs of parts of their daughter’s body surfacing from the ground? There is the revelation that Lee told friends she had been sexually abused as a child, a detail that has no bearing on this case, unless the filmmakers are suggesting that this may have been a motive for her murder, though this is not revisited. Our apparently insatiable interest in this case comes at a cost to her family. We don’t forget Lee, but maybe they wish we would.",Television & radio
"'Give me another series, you swine!' This Time was the very best of Alan Partridge The most remarkable thing about Alan Partridge is that he wasn’t hard to invent. While making On the Hour, as the story goes, Armando Iannucci asked Steve Coogan to do a voice for a sports reporter. Coogan came out with the now familiar tampon-up-the-nose timbre and someone spontaneously said “he’s an Alan”, immediately followed by someone else concluding “he’s a Partridge”. From that moment on, Iannucci says, “we knew what his background was, how he felt about being a sports reporter, how he wanted to move on and be taken more seriously”. This is not what usually happens; to create a character that’s believable, consistent, original, funny, sympathetic and interesting is immensely difficult. Just ask Dan Brown. It takes hours of tortuous work, but Alan didn’t. Alan and his driving gloves were waiting to come out. They say truly great songs (say Cuddly Toy by Roachford) almost sound like you’ve heard them before, and it’s the same with great characters. There’s something awfully familiar about Alan Gordon Partridge. Everyone’s met an Alan. The father-in-law who criticises your choice of motorway. The train passenger who frowns at people speaking Spanish. The pub bore who complains about the prominence of Fiona Bruce. Alan Partridge perfectly encapsulates a particular type of Englishman. And, whether you like it or not, he also encapsulates a part of you. The laughter he generates is one of relief; it’s a there-but-for-the-grace-of-god involuntary exhale. In fact, to write for the character Iannucci has said he and the writers actually had to become Alan by doing his voice and riffing from there. There aren’t many characters where this would prove fruitful because for that to work, they have to be perfectly realised. Characters like that a rarer than Alan in a Mini Metro. Basil Fawlty, David Brent, Del Boy, Patsy Stone, Mark Corrigan perhaps, but not many others. Alan’s character is so clearly defined that you know exactly how he would act in any given situation. This is true to such an extraordinary degree that he can sustain two autobiographies. Not just sustain but elevate them, and particularly their audiobooks, into works of comic genius. Over the last few years the Gibbons brothers, who wrote the autobiographies, have injected new life into a character so old you can hear his knees. They’ve moved him on from the obnoxious little Englander of I’m Alan Partridge to the almost well intentioned dinosaur of This Time. Alan’s unexpected return to primetime has forced him to confront movements like #MeToo that previous Alans would have dismissed out of leather-gloved hand. His interaction in last week’s episode with Peter the “shaved boy in a wig” was full of intriguing subtext. The lingering, almost wistful, look Alan gives Peter as he leaves the stage is one of a number of similar incidents – as in the opening episode when Alan mutters “No, we mustn’t” to a hand washing expert in an Ishiguro-esque moment of thwarted passion – where we glimpse Alan’s rich inner life. More of the real Alan was on display in the finale, his conflict with co-host Jennie and the “stomping around like Carol Thatcher” jibe. The way the writers let us know moments later, when Jennie plays a recording, that Alan had already made another unflattering Carol Thatcher comparison is a stroke of brilliance. No writer worth their salt would ever repeat a joke like that unless the character demanded it. This tiny moment tells us a lot: the fact that he thinks these references are the height of sophisticated wit is pure Partridge. You can imagine Richard Madeley whipping out a similar zinger during an argument with Judy. The standout scene, however, was the chat with the sleep disorder consultant. The way it morphed from bum-scratching slapstick and Blair Witch stare to the quiet horror of “I could harm them but choose not to” is up there with the very best Partridge there has ever been. But perhaps the most impressive thing about this creation is his continued relevance. You only have to glance at the internet to see what a large part Alan still plays in contemporary culture. From the vital Accidental Partridge Twitter account to the endless Alan reaction gifs that punctuate conversations, he is there shrugging his way through public consciousness. Even on the biggest issue of the day he is a significant presence. Poking above the sea of humanity on the recent People’s Vote march was an indignant Alan Partridge next to an adapted version of his most famous line: “Give me another referendum, you shit.” He’d be furious.",Television & radio
"Arsenal go third after Aaron Ramsey and Alexandre Lacazette sink Newcastle It does not feel that long ago that Arsenal trailed Tottenham by 10 points. What a turnaround there has been. This was a hard-fought victory over a Newcastle team who made a game of it in the second half but, when the dust had settled, the table showed Unai Emery’s team had leapfrogged two points clear of Spurs and Manchester United into third place. Aaron Ramsey fired Arsenal into a deserved first-half lead and, although Newcastle pushed, they did not threaten Bernd Leno’s goal. Alexandre Lacazette made the points safe with a perfectly executed lob and it added up to a 10th league win in succession at the Emirates Stadium. Not since the 1997-98 title-winning season have Arsenal managed that. “Are you watching Tottenham?” sang the home support. Arsenal play five of their remaining seven games away from home where they have been far less impressive but right now the momentum in the top-four battle is with them. In terms of the broader picture in this first season under Emery, one detail screamed for attention. The club have made it to 63 points, which was their final tally under Arsène Wenger last time out. The sense of progress is plain. Rafael Benítez came to contain as he always does in away matches against the top teams. The plan worked in so far as Arsenal did not enjoy the volume of opportunities they might have hoped for. Up until Lacazette’s late goal Newcastle were still in it. There were murmurings of frustration from the Arsenal fans. The statistics showed Newcastle managed only one shot on target – from Salomón Rondón in the 32nd minute, which Leno saved with a measure of comfort at the near post. Despite pressing higher up the pitch after half-time they could not prise Arsenal apart. The final pass was routinely missing. Newcastle’s dismal recent record in London continues while Benítez has not won at the Emirates in eight attempts with various clubs. Emery talked up the collective, as usual. He was without the injured Laurent Koscielny and Granit Xhaka while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was fit enough only for the bench, having struggled with a high temperature. But the manager found the solutions, with Ramsey stepping up to wear the captain’s armband with distinction until he was forced off with cramp. The midfielder will be a loss when he joins Juventus in the summer. Aubameyang, meanwhile, came on as a substitute to create Lacazette’s goal. Benítez commented on how Emery could summon a £56m striker from the bench and what he left unsaid hung heavily in the air. He craves greater backing in the market from the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, so he might go toe to toe with the opposition on occasions such as these but there does not seem any prospect of that. And so Benítez plays the percentages; keeping men behind the ball, trying to get something on the break. Ramsey thought he had scored before he actually did. In the 13th minute he swept home at the far post after Sead Kolasinac had flicked on Mesut Özil’s corner only for the whistle to blow. The replays showed Sokratis Papastathopoulos had pulled back Florian Lejeune by the sleeve. File it under soft. Ramsey was not to be denied and he made his own luck for the breakthrough, passing to Lacazette and darting for the return. His teammate could not provide it but the ball broke off DeAndre Yedlin and fell to Ramsey, who threaded a low shot into the far corner. Arsenal were urged on by Emery’s manic preachings from the technical area and they went close to a second goal in first-half added time. The marauding Kolasinac crossed for Lacazette and, when he pivoted to shoot, Martin Dubravka was beaten. Matt Ritchie, however, headed off the line. Benítez asked his wide players, Ayoze Pérez and Miguel Almirón, to push a little higher in the second half, to get themselves closer to Rondón, and Newcastle gained a foothold. At 1-0 they knew one moment could change everything. It did not come. Aubameyang was denied by Dubravka but there was nothing the goalkeeper could do to keep out Lacazette, after Jamaal Lascelles had misjudged Aubameyang’s through header to the striker. Emery reflected on how Arsenal had risen from the depths. “We lost our first two matches of the season to Manchester City and Chelsea and so we started last,” he said. “Now we are third. Our target is very clear but we know it’s going to be very difficult. We now need to convince everybody we can be consistent away from home.”",Football
"Lyft stalls as shares slip below IPO price on second day of trading Shares in Lyft, the ridesharing company, stalled on Monday, falling below their initial public offering (IPO) on their second day of trading. Lyft became the first of a new wave of giant tech companies to go public last Friday, selling shares at $72 a piece. The hotly anticipated sale saw Lyft’s share price leap to $78.89 on the first day of trading. But on Monday, as US markets rose, Lyft’s shares dropped close to 12%, ending the day at $69.03. New stocks often experience sharp swings in their first days of trading and the fall could soon reverse. But Lyft’s peers will be watching nervously. Over the coming months companies including Lyft rival Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest, Slack and WeWork are all expected to join the markets. Many of these companies are heavily loss making. Lyft lost $911m last year, Uber lost $1.8bn. While they are fast growing, stock market investors have recently shown little patience for hot tech companies that do not have a clear path to profitability. “Falling below its IPO price is a gut punch for investors and Lyft,” Wedbush’s managing director, Dan Ives, told CNBC. “This is a pivotal few weeks of trading ahead to gauge Street demand for the name as valuation and profitability continue to be the wild cards for tech investors.”",Technology
"The Guardian view on Brexit votes: put nation before party It is a matter of national shame that the civil war in the Conservative party led to the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union. That war continues today. The split is now between those who believe Britain needs a new partnership to maintain links with the EU, and those who think what’s required is a clean break. The level of ideological commitment to the latter idea might surprise many who consider the Tories the natural party of government. Supposedly a party of sceptics who distrust dogma, it has been torn by ideology over the course of much of its history. Theresa May has tried to keep both sides together with her Brexit deal. However, it has failed three times to convince enough of her own MPs, with resistance from both wings. Instead of seeing the referendum as a mistake to be ameliorated by wise counsel and sensible debate, many Conservatives have taken leave of their senses. There appears to be no limit to what the fanatics expect the rest of the world to do for Brexit Britain. In their world, nations will queue up to give us trading advantages and access to their markets, and abandon their instinct to protect their own industries in favour of the UK. This magical thinking has led Tory MPs to chase unicorns. A few think they have caught some. It is these delusions MPs were seeking to banish by voting on softer forms of Brexit; whether a confirmatory referendum was needed; and if revoking article 50 in the face of no-deal Brexit ought to be contemplated. None secured a majority on Monday night, though a customs union with the EU was only defeated by three votes. A plebiscite on the terms of departure missed by 12. Plainly there is a consensus waiting to be found. Mrs May remains boxed in by her own red lines and those of her hardliners. If she were to soften Brexit, she risks her colleagues not supporting her in a vote of confidence. If she does not, Mrs May faces the same threat from the majority in parliament who have already voted to prevent no deal. Mrs May may be tempted by self-interest for an early election. This would be a mistake, one that confuses party with nation. Those pushing Mrs May towards resolving Brexit at the ballot box see leaving the EU as a way of getting people to vote against their economic interests – a precondition for a Tory victory. About seven out of 10 Conservative MPs represent constituencies that voted to leave. Around six out of 10 Labour MPs represent leave constituencies. Some voters who delivered Brexit – especially left-leaning ones in poor areas – will suffer disproportionately from its policies. Yet the passion of Leave voters has intensified, lending Brexit a sour introspective nationalism. Culture wars could trump class wars. Hard Brexiters tap into this with the idea that leaving the EU could see a turbo-charged Thatcherism return. This would deliver a supply-side shock to the economy draped in populism and hostility towards Europe. It’s why they want Mrs May to act before the tyranny of the status quo sets in. A large section of the cabinet thinks nothing of putting ambition before nation. The flippant parochialism and narrow sectional interest of today’s Conservative party is quite breathtaking. It cannot be pretended that the tone of debate suggests that the Tory leadership is experiencing anything but its most self-absorbed hour. Appearing remote, self-interested and unaccountable is not a good look. That is why politicians must come together. The 2016 referendum vote needed to be interpreted in a meaningful way: with transformative policies to address what gave rise to it; a plan to deal with the harmful consequences of leaving the EU; and a device to underscore any Brexit deal’s democratic validity. Instead Brexit is becoming about partisanship and signalling values. The most damaging effect of entrenching a belief that government cannot make a difference is that it deserts those for whom it could to the whims of fantasists and ideologues.",Opinion
"Weatherwatch: UK could learn from Bermuda to avoid water shortages England could be facing chronic water shortages within 25 years, the Environment Agency warned recently. The problem stems from a growing population, leaking pipes from water companies, extravagant use of water by households and the growing threat from climate change. These problems are especially acute in the south-east, with low yearly rainfall and where there is actually less clean water per person than Sudan or Egypt. Bermuda has overcome its own water shortages by catching rainwater from roofs. Some 400 years ago the houses were built with steps on their sloping roofs to slow down the flow of rain. This helps stop the rain overwhelming the roof gutters before passing down into underground storage tanks. This ingenious arrangement makes the islanders self-sufficient in water, and also means they are acutely aware of how precious their water is and so go to great trouble to use it as efficiently as possible. The iconic stepped roofs of Bermuda are also painted white, reflecting the sunlight to help purify the water and also help keep the houses cooler.

"Wiggling buttocks enliven existential hell of Brexit debate The people finally got to have their say on the government’s Brexit deal. In parliament, no less. And what they had to say was that they wanted to take almost all their kit off and protest against climate change instead. Time management. They probably reckoned there was more chance of the world’s politicians agreeing on plans to save the planet than anyone coming up with a Brexit solution that the government was prepared to implement. The protest began three-quarters of an hour into the latest iteration of the indicative vote process, aka IV2, with 12 men and women in the public gallery stripping down to their pants to reveal climate change slogans on bodies that were far from beach-ready. Well, almost all of them. One bloke either lost his bottle or suddenly realised he had come out dressed commando and chose to keep his trousers on. Spoilsport. Most rushed to the front and glued their hands to the glass barrier, while a woman, daubed in grey body paint and wearing a pair of elephant ears and trunk, indulged in some unusual interpretive dance. The police were called but didn’t seem entirely sure where to look. Or touch. So what followed was a very awkward, very British standoff. In its way, the perfect Brexit statement. The dirty dozen would occasionally self-consciously wiggle their bums and then stop, as if waiting for something to happen. Knowing how to end a protest is always much harder than starting one. The police initially appeared to just hope the men and women would get bored and wander off, but once they realised they were going to have to get hands-on, a few officers reluctantly rolled up their sleeves. First to be removed from the gallery was the elephant woman who got carried out horizontally while waving goodbye with her trunk. Eventually, just a man and a woman were left and officials were sent off to find some substance to remove the glue from their hands. That seemed to do the trick and, half an hour after it had begun, the protest was over. All that remained were a few stains on the glass. Twelve semi-naked men and women in their pants was rather more entertaining and no weirder than anything else that happens in parliament these days and a few MPs greeted the disturbance as a welcome distraction. Peter Kyle snarfed about a cheeky intervention, Justine Greening asked him to flesh things out while Nick Boles wondered if Bernard Jenkin was among the protesters. Bernie’s naturism – he’s a legend in his own lunchbox – is by far his cleanest and most endearing pastime. Anything to relieve the tedium. But mostly everyone in the chamber chose to keep their heads down and plod on. IV2 more closely resembled an IV drip of liquid valium with MPs mindlessly repeating what they had said in the first round of debates the previous Wednesday. There was little else they could do. Everything that could possibly be said about Brexit has long since been said. Again and again. The sense of Brexit being an endless loop in space-time is now inescapable. After insisting the prime minister was keen to work constructively with parliament, Andrea Leadsom went out of her to do precisely the opposite by saying that the government would be whipping against the business motion to allow further indicative votes. Time was now of the essence and it was up to the government to run down the clock by failing to get its own deal passed and not up to MPs to try to find some kind of consensus. Thereafter we just got stuck in an existential hell with MPs reduced to playing caricature versions of themselves. Edward Leigh merely suggested that now was not the time for the country to have a general election because the Conservatives would lose, while the Grand Wizard of Mogg himself chose to lecture the house on the meaning of shame. Having traded his principles for the party line and refused to take responsibility for retweeting far-right politicians, Jacob Rees-Mogg increasingly resembles the badly behaved prep school boy who has been found out by his peers and sent to the naughty step. Edward Leigh was Edward Leigh. That bad. Things did improve when the debate proper began. But only marginally. Most MPs are sick and tired of being sick and tired. No one said anything unexpected or did much to suggest they had changed their minds. No one wanted to be the person who blinked first. Everyone was now waiting on a miracle. That never came. The opposition benches were full at 10pm for the results of the indicative votes. The government benches were barely half-full. It was only Brexit, after all. Yet again parliament was unable to find anything which for which it was in favour. Seemingly natural allies proved to be deadly enemies, as the remainer purists outdid one another to shoot down the possibility of a soft Brexit. The Life of Brian’s Time’s Arrow once again. The People’s Front of Judea versus the Judean People’s Front. First as farce, then as tragedy. Theresa May seemed amazed. Her deal had the flicker of a pulse. Never let the perfect be the enemy of the wee bit shit. For Nick Boles, enough was enough. Having received almost no support from his own party for his common market 2.0 option, he made an emotional speech in which he resigned the Conservative whip. It was the most effective protest of the day.",Politics

"Morning mail: Reef lobbying, more Brexit votes, Erdoğan challenged Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 2 April. Top stories After spending more than two years trying to shed light on Australia’s enormous lobbying effort to prevent the Great Barrier Reef from being listed as “in danger” by Unesco, a legal expert has slammed Australia’s freedom-of-information regime.. A group of Australian and US environmental lawyers had found the dangers to the reef overwhelmingly met the criteria for such a listing, but Australia’s lobbying was ultimately successful. The legal academic, Prof Reece Walters of Deakin University, wanted to understand how far Australia had gone in its taxpayer-funded campaign. He lodged a freedom-of-information request in August 2016 for relevant correspondence but was given heavily redacted documents. Eventually, the information commissioner ordered the authority to disclose more but the information was not what he wanted and years of delays rendered it almost useless. MPs are voting Monday evening UK time on four alternatives to Theresa May’s thrice-rejected Brexit deal, including a customs union and a Norway-style deal, as backbenchers seek to force the government to change course. With 11 days to go until Britain is due to leave the European Union, with or without a deal, the speaker, John Bercow, selected four of the options tabled by MPs for consideration in “indicative votes”. They are a customs union; a “common market 2.0”; a “confirmatory” referendum; and a motion aimed at allowing parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit. And earlier on Monday, the Brexit debate was disrupted by semi-naked protesters. The Morrison government will use Tuesday’s budget to allow 65 and 66-year-olds to make voluntary superannuation contributions without meeting the current work test. The proposal, to take effect from 2020-21, is part of the government’s efforts to court older voters ahead of the looming federal election, and potentially benefits 55,000 people. (Follow the Guardian politics liveblog from 8am, with full budget coverage from 7.30pm). Meanwhile, Liberal party senator Arthur Sinodinos has broken ranks on the eve of the budget to call for an increase to the Newstart allowance, becoming the first government MP to do so. “Over time it should be higher,” the New South Wales senator told the ABC’s Q&amp;A program. “There is a cost to the budget, there’s an expense. But budgets are all about choices.” Noting he was expressing a “personal view” not government policy, Sinodinos said his position was shared by former prime minister John Howard, who called for a boost to the payment in May last year. He also appeared to question the government’s decision to exclude those on the payment from a budget cash splash that will hand nearly four million welfare recipients a one-off payment to cover energy bills. World Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s grip on Turkey has been challenged by a resurgent opposition in local elections, with his ruling Justice and Development party losing control of Ankara and on track to lose Istanbul, according to unofficial local election results. As former US vice-president Joe Biden faced intense scrutiny of his behaviour towards women, the wife of former defence secretary Ash Carter has dismissed claims that a picture of her with Biden was an example of unwanted touching. Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, has called on armed pro-government groups to help subdue unrest as he announced a 30-day electricity rationing plan set to inflict further pain on the population. A group of Google employees have called for the removal of a rightwing thinktank leader from the company’s new artificial intelligence council, citing her anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant record. An off-duty Swedish police officer successfully arrested a violent fugitive drug dealer while both men were naked in a Stockholm sauna. “This was about as stripped-back and bare-bones an arrest as it is possible to make, in several senses of the term,” said Christoffer Bohman, the deputy chief of police in the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby. Opinion and analysis Insects have “no place to hide” from climate change, scientists have said after analysing 50 years’ worth of UK data. The study found that woodlands, whose shade was expected to protect species from warming temperatures, are just as affected by climate change as open grasslands. The research examined records of the first springtime flights of butterflies, moths and aphids, and the first eggs of birds between 1965 and 2012. As average temperatures have risen, aphids are now emerging a month earlier, and birds are laying eggs a week earlier. The scientists said this could mean animals were becoming “out of sync” with their prey, with potentially serious ramifications for ecosystems. Australia’s global leadership on whale conservation will be tested as Japanese hunters move to a different hemisphere, writes Darren Kindleysides.

Sport Australia is copying New Zealand’s policy of resting Test players in Super Rugby to ensure they are fresh and fit for the World Cup in Japan.

But with a post-season system that rewards over half the teams in the league, which of the six have really earned their place? Thinking time: What’s next for the Murray-Darling? Since Guardian Australia investigated the Murray-Darling a year ago, the health of Australia’s greatest river system and the $13bn plan to save it have been thrust into the centre of the national political debate, writes Anne Davies. The most dramatic warning has been the deaths of hundreds of thousands of fish at Menindee. The deaths of 40 and 50-year-old Murray cod, which survived the millennium drought of the early 2000s but perished this time around, horrified Australians and raised serious questions about the management of the river. There are now marked policy differences between the Coalition and Labor at state and federal level over what should happen next under the plan, though both major parties remain committed to retaining the plan itself. The question is: can the basin plan be reformed – and the remaining $4.5bn be spent constructively – without the key stakeholder states and the farming lobby pulling out of the plan?

"Grand National to feature two female jockeys with Blackmore set to join Kelly Rachael Blackmore is expected to be aboard Valseur Lido in Saturday’s Grand National, making two female jockeys now set to take part in the famous Aintree marathon. Blackmore, who is currently second in the race to be champion jockey in Ireland, will join Lizzie Kelly in the race, Kelly having already been booked to partner Tea For Two. No woman rider has won the National, though Katie Walsh rode the third-placed Seabass in 2012. Valseur Lido is the last remaining National entrant for Henry de Bromhead, for whom Blackmore rides as first jockey, following the withdrawal on Monday of Sub Lieutenant. De Bromhead confirmed Valseur Lido as an intended runner and said: “His form’s a little bit in and out but probably one of his best runs in the last 12 months was in the National last year, so we’re hoping the fences will bring the best out in him. “I thought he was running well at Cheltenham, Rachael was really happy with him and then he made a desperate mistake about five out and that just took him out of the race completely. His third in the Bobbyjo before that was a great run, we were delighted. He’s in great form.” De Bromhead added: “I’m pretty sure Rachael is going to ride; we just haven’t finalised plans.” Speaking for the owners, Gigginstown Stud, Eddie O’Leary said: “The ride on Valseur Lido is Rachael’s if she wants it.” Blackmore had a first tilt at the National last year, on Alpha Des Obeaux, who was tracking the leaders when he fell at the Chair. Valseur Lido was eventually well held in eighth place under Keith Donoghue but he had been a close fourth at the home turn and his stamina may last longer this time, as he has dropped down the weights by 12lb and will appreciate the better ground. The betting market, however, appears to view him as a back-number and he is on offer at 100-1. A variety of different coloured caps will once more be needed to distinguish between the Gigginstown-owned runners, as there are likely to be seven in Saturday’s National. O’Leary said Davy Russell will be on Tiger Roll, maintaining last year’s winning combination. Jack Kennedy is to be offered his pick of the remaining five, Monbeg Notorious, Dounikos, A Toi Phil, General Principle and Blow By Blow. Gordon Elliott, who trains six of Gigginstown’s seven, has a total of 12 horses in the top 40 of the Grand National weights. He has said that Mala Beach needs the ground to be softer than the current “good to soft, good in places” but he may get his wish, as there is rain forecast for Aintree this week. The record for most National runners from a single stable is 10, set by Elliott’s mentor, Martin Pipe, in 2001. Those taken out of the race on Monday included Ms Parfois, who is reported to be lame. Yala Enki was perhaps the most surprising withdrawal. The absence of Daklondike will be a relief to officials, in light of his bad behaviour at the start of last month’s Eider Chase, when he refused to race. There was some official confusion as to the elimination order of horses at the bottom of the weights but it has now been announced that Captain Redbeard is assured of a place in the National line-up, as he is 40th in the list. Bless The Wings had been 40th in the list published earlier on Monday but he now needs one of those above him to be withdrawn in order to get into the race. Joe Farrell, last year’s Scottish National winner, needs two to come out. The hopes of their connections were dented when Warrior’s Tale and Valtor were confirmed as intended runners, following signs that they might run in the Topham on Friday instead.",Sport
"'Desperate mood' in No 10 as insiders pondered snap election Inside the No 10 bunker, there has been heated discussion about whether a snap general election fronted by Theresa May remains a possibility. But with the Conservatives plunging below Labour in the polls this weekend and the party’s split over Europe looking increasingly irreconcilable, there are growing warnings from Tory grandees that even entertaining such a course of action is deeply unwise. “It was certainly being tested,” said one Downing Street adviser. “Some people weren’t exactly arguing in favour, but were saying it could be the least worst option.” Stephen Parkinson, May’s political secretary and a former Vote Leave organiser, and Robbie Gibb, the Downing Street director of communications, were named as the main voices considering whether to take May’s deal to the people. But a No 10 source denied in the strongest terms that Gibb in particular was in favour of such action. Suspicions that May is considering a snap poll were raised by her address to the public from No 10 lambasting parliament for frustrating Brexit, and money was spent on Facebook advertisements promoting her message. Speculation was then dampened again by May’s promise to stand down if her deal was passed, with Conservative MPs reassured that she could not possibly lead a general election as a “lame duck” who had signalled that she was ready to hand over to a colleague for the second phase of negotiations. But then the opinion resurfaced again in No 10 that she could carry on in power for longer by taking her deal to the public, pitching the Conservatives as the party of Brexit against a Labour party that would argue for a softer Brexit and only with a second referendum. May’s decision to call a third futile vote on her deal last week then looked like an attempt to portray Labour as voting against the withdrawal agreement on 29 March – the date that would have been Brexit day. One of the arguments is that the threat of a snap election is a useful tool to frighten some more Eurosceptic MPs into voting for May’s Brexit deal, but a small contingent in No 10 still think there is a genuine chance that she could win. There is also the possibility that the party could be plunged into a general election by accident if May’s government falls in a vote of no confidence and parliament is unable to find an alternative leader with a majority within 14 days. However, over the weekend, May was quickly confronted with warnings that the Tory party is in no way ready for an election, in terms of money, organisation, the backing of her own MPs or support in the country. In no uncertain terms, the prime minister has been told by senior Conservative party figures that it would risk “annihilation” and Jeremy Corbyn being installed in No 10. This is the stark reality that she is expected to present to cabinet on Tuesday morning, as it considers the various options to break the impasse in parliament and the Tory party. Lord Hayward, the Conservative peer and election expert, said: “The prime minister has been given the message loud and clear that there should not be an election. If you are a Conservative MP with anything other than a massive majority, you do not want one.” He said polls and byelection results suggested May’s address to the public lambasting MPs had initially not gone down badly, but any benefit of that had been lost by the indication that she would stand down if her Brexit deal was passed. William Hague, the former Conservative leader, said on Monday night that an election would result in the party’s “ruin”. Part of the problem appears to have been that No 10 was given hope about May’s chances with the public because of data that suggested she was not unpopular with the country. But senior Tories note there is a difference between voters feeling sorry for a prime minister struggling to deal with enormous Brexit difficulties and deciding that the Conservatives are the party they want to vote into government. From cabinet ministers to senior backbench MPs, in both the leave and remain camps, there is widespread despair in the party that anyone in Downing Street could be considering such a path at such a time. “It is nailed-on mad. But the mood in No 10 is desperate. They are in a bunker and in denial about how bad things are,” said one special adviser. Several Downing Street advisers rejected the often repeated suggestion that they operate in a bunker and argued that their plan has always been about listening to the public. A No 10 source said: “We have been trying to find a way to deliver the referendum result. But the point we keep making is that if parliament doesn’t want the deal or no deal, parliament has got to come to a decision about what it does want. “The country, government and parliament has to find a way through. The pressure really needs to be on those people, and particularly the Labour party. They say they want to leave, but every single option is rejected.” In public, May’s warnings that parliament is coming to the end of its ability to take a decision on Brexit have been interpreted as an oblique warning that a general election may be the only way out. However, two people who have spent time with the prime minister recently conclude that she does not regard the idea of fighting another election with relish, even if it would give her a mandate to stay in power. In fact, they say she is listening closely to the views of Gavin Barwell, her chief of staff, and “JoJo” Penn, the deputy chief of staff and her longterm adviser, who are of a softer Brexit persuasion than some of their colleagues and concerned about the impact of a snap election. And one Tory MP pointed out that it might suit the prime minister to threaten an election in a last-ditch attempt to bring Eurosceptics to heel, but it would certainly not be good for her legacy to be the prime minister that not only lost a majority, mishandled Brexit and split the Conservative party for good, but handed the keys to No 10 to Jeremy Corbyn for a decade. May’s top advisers Robbie Gibb May’s influential director of communications is a former head of the BBC’s political team at Westminster, who is guided by his deep knowledge of the broadcast media and connections across the Conservative party. He is viewed as a firm Brexiter. Stephen Parkinson He worked with May in the Home Office, so is a very trusted aide. He was subsequently instrumental in the ground war of the Vote Leave operation. Gavin Barwell The chief of staff is a former MP who lost his seat in 2017 and was previously a strong remain supporter. He tweeted after the 2016 referendum: “Proud that my home town [Croydon] and the great city of which it is part rejected the politics of hate and division yesterday.” Joanna Penn May’s most senior female adviser has been with her since the Home Office and is known to have the prime minister’s ear. Philip May The prime minister’s husband is an investment manager for his day job but also part of her inner circle and a close adviser.",Politics
"Bolton players refuse to train for 48 hours after staff salaries unpaid again Bolton Wanderers players are refusing to train for 48 hours after staff were not paid their salaries on time for the second month in succession. Players are bemused at the situation and the lack of information they have been given so have now taken action. This is the second time in as many months that the financially-stricken Championship club has failed to source wages, the squad having had to wait for its February pay until the second week of last month. Then Ken Anderson, the owner, finally provided the monies. Facing a similar predicament for March Anderson stated last Wednesday that if Bolton were sold the month’s salaries would have been paid on Friday of that week. Yet despite Anderson maintaining then he had an agreement in principle to sell Bolton and the deal could be completed within “48 hours” nothing occurred and players and staff again did not receive wages. Anderson was in a similar position regarding the proposed sale of the club in February with a consortium led by Parminder Basran, a businessman, but this fell through. A week later, Bolton stated different takeover discussions with another interested buyer had also ended. The club were later given two weeks to settle their outstanding debts or risk going administration after appearing in the high court over an unpaid £1.2m tax bill. The case is expected to be listed at the high court on 3 April. They avoided a winding-up order then by telling the high court they were in the process of selling the club to a mystery buyer, but no deal ever came to fruition. The adjournment, though, meant they have avoided 12-point deduction for this season. In March Anderson apologised “unreservedly” for the wait for in paying salaries. He said: “Cash flow has always been a problem at the club, both before and since I became involved, and if it wasn’t for [former owner] Ed Davies and my limited financial support, I can assure you things would have been far worse. “I understand why staff and supporters seem to believe that it’s the owner’s sole responsibility to just keep on personally topping up the bank accounts and pay everything and everybody, but unfortunately that’s not always possible.” Bolton who are second-bottom in the Championship five points from safety with seven games remaining. The club were not available for comment on Monday afternoon.",Football
"Can marijuana help end the opioids crisis? Legalization opponents call marijuana a “gateway drug” that leads users to more dangerous substances. But could it also be an “exit drug” that helps ease the opioids crisis? The data is scarce, but the anecdotes are plentiful. After more than a decade in the US air force, Jennifer Baxter needed foot surgery. It wasn’t successful, and she had to have two more procedures to correct her “severely disfigured, painful and mechanically incorrect foot”. Baxter had had surgeries before, and had taken opioids to recover. But, as she tells it, this time she connected with a civilian doctor known for his generosity with pain medication. After receiving a medical retirement, Baxter was prescribed her 600 pills a month, including 480 oxycodone (a generic version of the opioid OxyContin), she said. Soon the month’s oxycodone lasted only 21 days. She lost her career, gained an unhealthy amount of weight and contemplated suicide. “I was watching the clock all day every day for three and a half years,” she said. She heard medical marijuana might be helpful and began using it in spring 2016. Balancing it with the slow-release morphine to stave off the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, she quit pills entirely in several months. Today Baxter, 40, has a new life. She is engaged to be married. She volunteers with rescue animals and is involved in her church. She has lost weight and lives in Arizona, where she can legally obtain medical marijuana for her pain, PTSD and insomnia. She takes it nightly and sometimes during the day. In 2017, a record 47,600 Americans died of opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grim tally represents an increase of more than 10% from 2016, the previous record year. More Americans die from opioid overdoses than car crashes or gunshots. Almost no one considers marijuana to be as ruinous for individuals or society. But legalization activists and the industry have marshalled anecdotal evidence and personal testimonies to support the notion that cannabis can help people wean themselves off opioids. As with all issues surrounding medical marijuana, there’s not much good data. Despite encouraging stories like Baxter’s – I’ve heard lots of them – there have been no formal clinical trials to determine whether cannabis is an effective treatment for opioid addiction. And cannabis remains unproven as an adequate substitute for opioids in treating chronic pain, which is how many addictions begin, sometimes after car or work-related accidents. Despite public perceptions, the evidence for cannabis as a painkiller “is actually weak and … riddled with limitations”, the psychologist Jonathan M Stea wrote recently in Scientific American. However, studies have consistently shown that in states where medical marijuana is legal, doctors write fewer opioid prescriptions and patients consume lower doses of opioids. (One study released in 2018 found evidence that states with legal medical marijuana saw fewer prescriptions for weaker “schedule III” opioids but not the more addictive and powerful schedule II drugs.) Despite the paucity of data, the “exit drug” theory has led to overwhelming support for medical marijuana research among veterans. Several US states allow anyone with an opioid prescription to obtain a medical marijuana card. The interest in cannabis as a substitute for opioids comes as opioid makers face escalating scrutiny and legal trouble. In March, a group of more 600 US cities, counties and Native American tribes filed a lawsuit alleging that “eight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the opioid epidemic”. The family, the Sacklers, control Connecticut-based Purdue Pharmaceuticals, which introduced OxyContin in 1996. The family denied the allegations in a statement. Last week, Purdue and the Sackler family agreed to pay $275m to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of Oklahoma. (The family was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.) Whatever caused the opioid crisis, it is a deeply complex problem, one that few if any credible observers think will be relieved by cannabis alone. And some reject the idea of employing a drug as an appropriate response to a drug crisis. “When we are dealing with opioids as the single biggest health crisis this state has ever had, you are going to tell me legalizing more drugs is the answer?” New Hampshire’s Republican governor, Chris Sununu, said last fall. “Absolutely not.”",Society
"Alex Hales: ‘It takes 10 seconds to get an image, 10 years to undo it’ It is media day at a sun‑drenched Trent Bridge and after Nottinghamshire’s players pose for various photographs, larking around as they do so during a spring ritual that precedes another county season, Alex Hales sits down in front of the old pavilion for a chat. The England batsman may hail from south Buckinghamshire but this is home; the place where, in 2009 aged 20, he announced himself with a then futuristic 150 not out from 102 balls in a televised Pro40 match against Worcestershire; where he took the West Indies attack for 99 from 68 in just his fourth England outing three years later; where, in recent times, scores of 171 and 147 have powered Eoin Morgan’s trailblazing side to two world-record one-day totals. Come the World Cup there is a case for Hales to be among the first names on the teamsheet to face Pakistan at Trent Bridge in England’s second group game on 3 June. After all, it is a playing surface he claims to know “like the back of his hand” and one on which, in international cricket, his long-levered style averages 90 from seven innings via an eye‑watering strike-rate of 139. It’s a neat idea but one which may be funkier than the world’s No 1 team need to be. After all, as has been the case since he and Ben Stokes got tangled up in a street fight at 2.30am on 25 September 2017 following a one-dayer against West Indies in Bristol, Hales sits outside the first-choice XI. From having been central to the first half of Morgan’s revolution, he has spent 18 months as an overqualified first reserve, dropping in when injury allows but running drinks in the main, looking on while Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow have forged one of the world’s most explosive opening combinations. This is his first in-depth interview since the whole sorry saga was wrapped up last December when, for his part in it, Hales accepted two charges from the cricket disciplinary commission of bringing the game into disrepute. One was for the fight, the second for lewd images that circulated in the aftermath, with the commission handing down a six-match suspension and fines of £17,500 (four games and £10,000 of which were suspended for 12 months). As you might expect with a sportsperson, the on-field punishment hurt the most. “I won’t lie, there have been days when it has gnawed away at me,” Hales says. “The fines and everything were a dent but the biggest thing was losing my spot. The day I found out I wasn’t playing [the final two ODIs against West Indies] I knew Jason would come in and score big runs. He’s too good a player. And Jonny was in the best form of his life. I saw it coming and it unfolded in slow motion.” Hales is not looking for sympathy. The events that took place near the Mbargo nightclub were serious enough for him to know he cannot reasonably grumble about his lot. They have been well documented too, albeit with the three men who were tried on charges of affray – Stokes, Ryan Ali and Ryan Hale – offering conflicting explanations in court before ultimately all were cleared. Nevertheless it would be remiss not to ask Hales about certain aspects of his own involvement, not least having himself avoided a criminal charge despite video footage both of him kicking Ali during the melee, and then telling a police officer he was not present as Stokes was being arrested. Were those kicks the real Hales? “Not really but it was just a sticky situation seeing a guy with a bottle on the ground. What do you do? Stand there and do nothing? He [Ali] could have glassed Ben and it would have been a hell of a lot worse. You have to make a decision in that time. The guy had a weapon in his hand, he was on the floor and scrapping with a friend.” Ali told the trial he was holding the bottle in self defence. He said he had no recollection of going towards Hales with the bottle but accepted the video footage showed both that and that he struck another man with the bottle. His defence barrister, Anna Midgley, told the court Ali had been drinking from the bottle. “He didn’t arm himself but there came a time when he used it because he was threatened.” There “may have been a misunderstanding” which caused the violence to erupt, she added. And how does Hales explain lying to the police – another aspect of the case that was shown on camera in court? “That is one of my real regrets from that night. It was just a really immature moment. I wish I’d said I saw exactly what happened and I was there – but I panicked. I didn’t want to make the situation worse. I just hoped Ben would be released in the morning and that would be the end of it. Nothing would come of it. “[Stokes] did say to me to disappear. But that is still a regret and watching the footage back I was just cringing, seeing myself lying. I just panicked and said something. I cocked up. The lesson is, tell the truth.” Like Stokes, Hales claims it was a case of stepping in to defend two others – clubbers Kai Barry and Billy O’Connell – from being assaulted, something Hale and Ali both denied in court. “I think every situation that could have resulted wouldn’t have been a good one,” Hales says. “All six of us wish we could go back to that night and all gone our separate ways.” Looking on from the outside during the legal proceedings – neither he, Barry nor O’Connell were called as witnesses – Hales says he suffered. While he was questioned under caution, he was never arrested and he recalls his reaction at not being prosecuted. “Of course it was a huge relief,” he says. “The whole situation was really tough to be a part of and to see Ben go through some really difficult times. It was tough [to watch the court case unfold] and I felt for his family, who are such nice people.” There were those, though, who thought Hales should have been on trial. A barrister for Hale, who was acquitted on the direction of the judge, criticised the crown prosecution service for not charging him. With the jury absent, Stephen Mooney had told the judge: “I struggle to understand how the crown, in adopting the stance they have, have come to the conclusion that overt acts of direct violence used by an individual to someone on the floor is not worthy of prosecution.” There was one final involvement, however, when, in front of the jury, Stokes’s lawyer, Gordon Cole QC, suggested in his closing speech that Ali’s fractured eye socket could just have easily been caused by the kicks from Hales and later crediting this element of doubt as a possible reason for the not-guilty verdict that resulted. Hales says: “It was tough to hear but at the end of the day, Ben and his team had to find a way to win the case. I wasn’t in court. That’s how it is.” Did it cause any issues between the pair? “Certainly not on my part. I don’t know his … but no, not for me. Fortunately that chapter is closed for both of us and we’re looking to move on. “It’s just shows, something can escalate from nowhere. It was also an eye-opener to how much we are in the public eye as England cricketers. You have to mature and put yourself in the right situations, not be out at 2.30am in the middle of a series. It’s a lesson learned the incredibly hard way.” On a personal level the “moving on” process is well under way, even if an element of his punishment must still be served this week when, at his own expense, he undergoes a training course in Birmingham. It relates to the use of social media after Snapchat images of him in a state of undress – ones he says dated back seven years – went viral during the fallout from Bristol. Cricket-wise, as well as trying to take his rare chances with England, Hales has spent the last 12 months as a white-ball specialist. Spells playing Twenty20 in Bangladesh and Pakistan during this winter just gone have caught the eye, not least since he joined Morgan in missing a tour to the former in 2016 for security reasons. “There was so much public interest at the time of that decision,” Hales says. “There had been a terrorist attack in Dhaka and I just didn’t feel comfortable, knowing we’d be the most high profile western people there. It didn’t sit well with me. “But two years is a long time. I spoke to guys on that tour, who said it was fine, and there have been two Bangladesh Premier Leagues since. I spoke to [the ECB security adviser] Reg Dickason and players from those tournaments and felt OK. Things can change.” Hales admits it is unlikely he will ever add to his 11 Test caps – “I think there are only a handful of players who can be truly world‑class at all three formats and having played all three, I’m not one of them. But I think I can be in white-ball” – and he now will look to see out his career in the shorter formats. He claims to be relishing the self-sufficiency this career path brings – the money, he claims, is so far slightly less than before – and is grateful to the “world-class” coaching staff at Nottinghamshire who, under Peter Moores, help cater for his specialism. But has he changed? Before speaking to Hales, two members of the England coaching setup were approached for a steer and the feedback was encouraging. He has, they said, redoubled his efforts in training over the past 18 months, worked heavily on some shortcomings in the field and upped his fitness levels. Nevertheless, the week before our chat a story appeared in the Sun newspaper about his private life. While not interested in the details, he is asked how it feels to be described as “cricket bad boy” in the intro. “That’s not something you like to hear. And I don’t think I’m bad,” he replies. “Sometimes I make mediocre decisions – I always have – but I don’t want to make them any more. It takes 10 seconds to get an image and 10 years to undo it. I’m 30 now, not 20, and I’ll be doing whatever I can for the rest of my career to change perceptions. “The last year and a half, there have been ups and hell of a lot of downs. All I will be focusing on is cricket. It’s the biggest year in English cricket history. I will be doing everything I can to be the best I can. It’s been so special being in this England team and when you lose your spot you realise it.” Before we conclude, the age-old question is asked as to whether England can indeed win the World Cup. “Yep. I’m going for it and saying yes. I’m the most excited I have ever been. I really think we’re going to do something special,” he says with a smile. Whether he is part of the team who do so remains to be seen. But for all his previous shortcomings in the decision-making department, that a batsman with the talent of Hales is pushing hard in reserve can only augur well for their prospects.",Sport
"US woman kidnapped in Afghanistan tells court how she escaped ex-husband An American woman who spent five years with her family as hostages in Afghanistan has described in court how she escaped from her former husband’s alleged abuse after they returned to Canada. Caitlan Coleman told a packed Ottawa courtroom that on the night of her escape she put on several pairs of socks to prepare for a “dangerously cold” Ottawa winter night, because she could not reach her shoes from the bedroom where Joshua Boyle had confined her in a fit of rage. “I made the decision that I was going to run for it – run for help,” Caitlan said on Monday, as she described the moment she fled. “It took me a while to get up my courage to do it. But I did,” she said. Coleman, 33, and Boyle, 35, were kidnapped in 2012 by Taliban-linked militants while they were backpacking through Afghanistan. They spent five years as hostages and had three children in captivity, before they were eventually rescued by Pakistani forces in 2017. Boyle, 35, was arrested two months after their rescue, and charged with 19 offences including sexual assault, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats. All of the alleged offences took place after the couple returned to Canada. Boyle denies all charges. On the third day of Boyle’s trial, Coleman described of a pattern of physical and emotional abuse, which she said continued as the couple moved between Boyle’s family home, a hotel and an apartment building in Ottawa. Dressed in a dark dress and wearing a black headscarf, Coleman testified via video link from a separate room in the courthouse. She told the court that as well as subjecting her to physical and emotional abuse, Boyle deliberately confined her against her will. Coleman testified that on 30 December 2017, Boyle said she could only leave the apartment’s bedroom with his permission. The demand brought back memories of the most “horrifying parts” of their captivity in Afghanistan, when she says Boyle banished her to a shower stall, she alleged. Left alone in the bedroom which had a back door leading outside, Coleman decided to flee, she said. “This was my best chance – after tonight, it [was] only going to get harder,” she told the court. Coleman said she planned to run to a neighbour’s apartment upstairs and use their phone to call her mother, who was staying at a nearby hotel. Unable to reach her shoes – which were kept near the front door – Coleman put on several pairs of socks, then ran out of the back door and upstairs, where she started banging on the neighbours’ door, she said. Boyle followed closely behind, Coleman told the court. “In a very low voice that was threatening – just above a whisper – he said: ‘When they answer the door, you tell them you were drunk – and you come back in here.’” Boyle returned downstairs, but nobody answered the door, Coleman said. “I was hitting the door as loudly as I could … I was at their door yelling: ‘Help! Help!’” she told the court. Coleman ran outside to a nearby pizza restaurant, where she called her mother, she said. Later that evening, Boyle was arrested by Ottawa police. Throughout the testimony, Boyle, wearing a navy blazer with maroon slacks, took frequent notes on a white notepad. His sister was seated beside him. Coleman had previous testified that she had been subjected to violence, manipulation and sexual assault at the hands on Boyle. On Friday she told that court that on one occasion, he sent her a text message requesting she search online forums to find him a new sexual partner. On another, Coleman alleges she was sexually assaulted while tied up with ropes. She also revealed a list of rules Boyle had allegedly created for her, dictating her behaviour, diet, exercise and frequency of sex. On Monday, defence lawyer Lawrence Greenspon asked Coleman repeatedly if she was a “violent” person, citing an online comment Coleman had made in 2002. “I’m not a grump. I’m either easygoing or a terrifying spectre of volcanic rage,” he read, quoting Coleman’s posting on a Star Wars chat forum, where she first met Boyle at age 16. “I couldn’t tell you with any certainty what was written 20 years ago,” responded Coleman, who later referring to a number of her internet posts as “teenage melodrama”. As Greenspon pressed her on her previous online behaviour, Coleman requested a break. “Because of the trauma I’ve gone through, I’m feeling a bit triggered … I’m feeling a little bit attacked by your approach,” she told Greenspon. The defence also questioned Coleman’s ability to “see reality” while she was in a “fit of rage”. “I had trouble seeing reality with Joshua,” she responded. “That’s why I stayed with him as long as I did.” Of the 19 charges Boyle faces, 17 involve Coleman. The identity of a second victim is protected by a publication ban. The trial is expected to continue for another seven weeks.",World news
"Q&A recap: Arthur Sinodinos says Newstart should be higher Liberal party senator Arthur Sinodinos has broken ranks on the eve of the budget to call for an increase to the Newstart allowance, becoming the first government MP to do so. “Over time it should be higher,” the New South Wales senator told the ABC’s Q&amp;A program. “That’s probably a slightly radical thing for me to say here … but my observation is this does raise an issue that should be considered at some stage. There is a cost to the budget, there’s an expense. But budgets are all about choices.” Noting he was expressing a “personal view” not government policy, Sinodinos said his position was shared by former prime minister John Howard, who called for a boost to the payment in May last year. He also appeared to question the government’s decision to exclude those on the unemployment benefit from a budget cash splash that will hand nearly four million welfare recipients a one-off payment to cover energy bills. Sinodinos, a former cabinet minister who returned to parliament as a backbencher last year following a battle with cancer, said he did not know the “rationale” for the decision when asked by the host, Tony Jones. Newstart allowance is currently $277.85 a week for single people and, as a questioner to the panel noted, has not been lifted in 25 years. Both major parties have faced a sustained campaign from the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) over the historically low rate of the benefit, with welfare groups saying Labor’s policy to review the payment is inadequate. Amanda Rishworth, Labor’s early childhood spokeswoman, said the opposition had acknowledged the payment was “too low”. Rishworth accused the Coalition of “demonising people on Newstart”, although she would not explicitly state that the payment should be increased, instead reiterating Labor’s support for a review. “We know that people need that support and people might be cynical about a review but the review worked with the aged pension,” she said. “We worked out what the base rate [of the age pension] needed to be lifted. We made room in the budget. And got that base rate lifted in the pension to get pensioners out of poverty.” Asked about the government’s energy supplement payments, which are $75 for singles and $125 for couples, Rishworth said Labor “won’t stand in the way” of the legislation. Asked if Labor would extend the supplement to those on Newstart, she said the opposition would need to “look at the details”. John Roskam, of the rightwing free-market thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, also supported increasing Newstart, although he said that should be coupled with changes to industrial relations laws. “[Newstart] is about $6.50 an hour,” he said. “The minimum wage is about $18 an hour.” Sinodinos, Rishworth and Roskam were joined on the program by social researcher Rebecca Huntley and people’s panellist Lakshmi Logathassan. Last year, Deloitte said in a report for Acoss that increasing the incomes of the more than 700,000 people on Newstart by $75 a week would cost the federal budget $3.3bn a year, while boosting consumer spending. In September, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the better-than-expected budget bottom line was not a reason to “make whoopee” by increasing the rate of Newstart. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will hand down the Morrison government’s first budget – and the Coalition government’s sixth – on Tuesday night.",Australia news
"Archaeologists discover 'exceptional' site at Lake Titicaca An ancient ceremonial site described as exceptional has been discovered in the Andes by marine archaeologists, who recovered ritual offerings and the remains of slaughtered animals from a reef in the middle of Lake Titicaca. The remarkable haul points to a history of highly charged ceremonies in which the elite of the region’s Tiwanaku state boated out to the reef and sacrificed young llamas, seemingly decorated for death, and made offerings of gold and exquisite stone miniatures to a ray-faced deity, as incense billowed from pottery pumas. Tiwanaku state arose in the Lake Titicaca basin, around the border of modern Bolivia and Peru, between the 5th and 12th centuries AD, and went on to become one of the largest and most influential in the Andes. Formed by a natural fault that divides the Andes into two mountain ranges, the basin is a unique ecosystem with an “inland sea” set 3,800m above sea level. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the basin was home to an estimated 1 million people. Marine archaeologists decided to explore the Khoa reef after amateur divers found a number of ancient items at the site. The reef is submerged in more than 5m of water about 10km off the northwestern tip of the Island of the Sun, a central feature of Lake Titicaca. The researchers excavated a trove of artefacts including a lapis lazuli puma figurine and other miniature stone animals, ceramic puma incense burners and gold ornaments including engraved sheets, a medallion, and an L-shaped piece marked with puma and condor silhouettes. Perforated gold leaves still attached to fragments of leather may have been used to make ear tassels and other regalia to dress young llamas killed in the ancient ceremonies, the researchers believe. Taken together, the items reveal how the lavish ceremonies displayed and disposed of the most prestigious materials that money could buy in the ancient Andean empire. Besides the gold and the carved and polished stones were spiny oyster shells from the warm waters off the Ecuadorian coast, nearly 2,000km away. They could only have been obtained through trade. “What is great about these artefacts is that, beyond their beauty and the quality of manufacture, they were discovered in an undisturbed context,” said Christophe Delaere, a marine archaeologist at the University of Oxford and the Free University of Brussels. “This is one of the advantages of underwater heritage. Lake Titicaca protects its ancient material culture from time and man. Never before have so many artefacts of this quality been discovered. The history that these objects tell us is exceptional.” Found alongside the artefacts were llama bones and the remnants of burnt fish, the latter of which are thought to have been eaten during the ceremonies. Carbon dating of charcoal and bones at the site found that the offerings were made throughout the 8th and 10th centuries AD, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The ancient offerings are not the first riches to be recovered from Lake Titicaca, but the exceptional quality and abundance of the items puts the reef at the heart of the Tiwanaku people’s beliefs and ritual landscape. One of the major questions surrounding Tiwanaku state is how it expanded so effectively across the Titicaca basin in the first millennium. Charles Stanish, an anthropologist on the team from the University of South Florida, said that pilgrimages leading up to elaborate ceremonies were a crucial part of the state structure. Through ritual, religion and “supernatural punishers”, the state encouraged cooperation and deterred freeloaders and other rebels. “What we’ve discovered in the Titicaca basin are pilgrimages and ritual processions and these are part of the state apparatus. As you participate in them you are reinforcing the power of the state,” Stanish said. “Combined with what’s been found off other islands in the 1990s, the discovery of these items on the reef shows us there was probably a series of pilgrimages or precessions around the lake and I find that to be extremely exciting.” More than a dozen Tiwanaku sites have been found on the Island of the Sun. One, near the north-west shore, is a puma-shaped ceremonial complex. But from Khoa reef, those taking part in a water ceremony would have a panoramic view of the lake and the spectacular surrounding mountains. “It is not surprising that the Tiwanaku elite appropriated this space for costly and highly charged ceremonies,” the authors write. “Ritual and religion were profoundly important in ancient states. It is not some new age-y thing,” said Stanish. “Ritual and religion structured people’s lives, it structured the economy and the whole of society. This is how these people were able to create spectacular ways to get along and have a very successful society.”",Science
"'He took my job': Ian Holloway hits out after Steve McClaren is sacked by QPR Queens Park Rangers have sacked manager Steve McClaren after a dismal run of form dropped them to 17th in the Championship – but their former manager, Ian Holloway, says he has no sympathy for the man who replaced him at Loftus Road. “He took my job,” Holloway told talkSPORT. “I still had another year left at the club. I’m still being paid by them now. [McClaren] was talking to the chairman while I was in the job saying what he’d do. He hasn’t been able to do that. What goes around comes around.” McClaren, appointed at Loftus Road last May, has overseen just one win since Boxing Day – against Leeds – as the club fell within eight points of the relegation zone, capped by Saturday’s 2-1 home defeat to Bolton. Holloway also claimed that he felt as if McClaren had taken his family from him. “He had my babies and took my kids,” Holloway said. “It means the world to me. I felt I was in the best position to do that job. The owners made their choice and that’s football at the end of the day. Would I go back? It depends who calls me. Les [Ferdinand] didn’t want me to go.” McClaren, who managed England in 2006 and 2007, oversaw a poor start to the campaign as the team lost their opening four matches, including a 7-1 defeat to West Brom. They then went on to win eight of their next 11 matches but their slide has resulted in McClaren’s dismissal. “Making a decision such as this is never easy, particularly when you are talking about someone as professional and dedicated as Steve,” said the club’s chief executive, Lee Hoos. “We are grateful to him for all his efforts during his time with us. It is well documented that we are in a period of transition as we work hard to make the club financially stable. “With that comes challenges, not least the cutting of the wage bill while aiming to remain competitive. As we look to the future, and taking recent results into account, we feel now is the right time to re-evaluate where we are.” The club’s director of football, Les Ferdinand, added: “Steve has worked incredibly hard during his time with us but as we start to make plans for next year we feel this change is necessary now, rather than wait until the end of the season, or risk having to make such a decision early in the new campaign.” The assistant manager, John Eustace, has been put in temporary charge of the first team prior to their next game against league leaders Norwich at Carrow Road on Saturday.",Football
"This is no time for a compromise with Brexiters: there is no middle way “Believe in Britain”, say leavers’ posters outside parliament. What sort of belief, as things fall apart? While Brexit voting consumed Westminster last Friday, another austerity tragedy slipped by unnoticed. In Hastings the doors shut for the last time on a day centre that was life support, comfort and company for 60 old people. I met Rose, Mary and Sal, who had sat together for years, and were now to be separated. Some of those ejected from the Isabel Blackman Centre will stay home alone. Some will soon go to expensive residential care, in the absence of the centre’s daily respite for their partners. Expect many to be in A&amp;E more often, along with others of the 1.8 million older people denied care. Some 54,000 older people died waiting for a care package last year, according to Age UK. In East Sussex seven local care centres have shut. The council is near bankrupt, due to cuts. As the Isabel Blackman Centre shut, the new minister for loneliness, Tracey Crouch, was not there to say goodbye to Rose, Mary and Sal. I left to catch the train back for the next episode of the Westminster psycho-drama, to see the MPs consumed by the furies, ambitions and panics of another Brexit vote. These things are linked. “Believe in Britain”? The real patriotic cause is to save us all from Brexit, from the damage any variety of Brexit will do, as the grip of austerity inevitably tightens following departure. Closing day centres wasn’t on the side of that notorious leave bus, of course. Comforting talk of “compromise” and “soft” Brexit is everywhere. But don’t be lulled into hoping for any such thing: there is no “middle way”; out is out. Don’t be soothed by the thought that a customs union would be better than the prime minister’s hard red lines. Don’t listen to the siren calls for customs union combined with single market membership. Closer ties of this kind, of course, feel better to remainers, but it’s a delusion to imagine they ease the path ahead. Because they don’t, unless confirmed by a public vote. Consider the future with realism: peace will not break out if a softened Brexit is hauled over the line by a bullied Commons majority. Remember what comes next: in short order we shall have a Brexiteering prime minister selected by a handful of Tory party members in shires and suburbs. He – it will be a he – will negotiate the real trade deal aiming for the hardest possible Brexit denouement. If the withdrawal deal eventually included the customs union, this new leader, along with his Brexit paratroopers and the pro-Brexit press would fight against it at every opportunity. Every time a new edict emerges from Brussels over which we had no say, they will lie about it, misrepresent it and stir up anti-EU fever. Coming soon is an EU ban on the pesticide chlorothalonil: farmers are already protesting. Vassalage! Brexiters will side with farmers or anyone unhappy with any EU rule. Watch them campaign to cut all final ties, escape the Brussels “yoke” and regulations over which we have no say. And unfortunately, given our new lack of political influence in Brussels, they will have a point. Obsessive Brexiters will never give up. Fear of that intransigence has made some remainers too ready to compromise. Remember 160 of them voted before for a no-deal outcome, despite EU warnings that there’s no such thing as an “orderly” no deal. These MPs know it would mean lorry queues, empty-shelf panic-buying and a medicines crisis. Even worse, it would mean the UK unilaterally breaking an international treaty, the Good Friday agreement, by causing a hard border. We would become a rogue state defaulting on our debts. The Brexiters cleverly call this a “clean Brexit”, but it’s a very dirty one; an insanely irresponsible dash for an illusory pure Brexit. The jubilation of Trump and Putin would know no bounds. But if fear of that is what makes some choose compromise, be reassured no deal can’t happen. Enough sensible MPs crossing every party line will do whatever it takes, including, as David Gauke suggests, bringing down their own government to stop it. Nor should the lure of compromise tempt Labour into becoming the Brexit enabler: it will pay a high price if it backs any Brexit without the support of a public vote. A soft Brexit stitched up in parliament will only prolong the culture war. Only the public can finally end the Brexit mania, but the choice put to voters must be fair. If the choice is only a “soft” customs union or remain, there would be a mighty stink from the leavers. Theresa May’s deal may not be hard enough for them, but it’s certainly not soft: the ballot paper choice must be her deal or remain. It’s true that those supporting a people’s vote may be too sanguine in their hopes of remain winning a referendum. Analysts such as Prof Robert Ford are raining on their parade. While his polling suggests a move towards remain, now 54:46 ahead, he finds few changing their minds. He describes remain support as “narrow and fragile”, relying on abstainers turning out, while campaign “symbols, slogans and slip-ups” could swing the outcome either way. Many fear that a referendum will just be too divisive, but there’s no other peaceful resolution on offer. Both sides will fight on without it. If the customs union version is put to the vote, the risk is that voters choose it as a fictitious “compromise”, making Brexit more likely. Yet most bad effects of Brexit will still follow, with a final trade deal that could be as hard as Canadian rocks. Moreover, the customs union only covers goods – 20% of our economy, not the remaining 80% bound up in services. Above all, a customs union Brexit will leave the angry Brexiters banging on about vassalage forever. There is no compromising with Brexiters. Only the public can end the debate, either choosing an actual Brexit deal laid before them, or coming to the conclusion that there is no deal better than the one we have. The mood music of a pro-EU campaign needs to reflect the warmth of our neighbours, the affection they have shown in making it as easy as they can for us to stay, despite the hordes of Faragist bores and boors we sent to abuse them daily in the European parliament. As for prospective Euro-elections in May, don’t fear them but seize the chance to send better neighbours to Brussels this time. And afterwards, if we remain, don’t let another good crisis go to waste. We wasted the 2008 crash by “spaffing cash up the wall” of banks instead of economy-building with Keynesian state spending. There are good crisis lessons to take from this Brexit fiasco: building up regional power and finance; taking social injustice seriously; civilising Westminster by opening its doors with proportional representation. Don’t let go of the new sovereignty parliament has won from the over-mighty executive – and warmly embrace and promote the good the European Union brings us. The doors slamming shut on that day centre in Hastings felt like a symbol, a signal and a warning. If Brexit happens, under a Brextreme prime minister, there will be a lot more of that and little of the kind of politics that could make us “Believe in Britain”. This is not the moment to wobble and compromise: any Brexit is a bad Brexit and it can still be stopped. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Opinion
"The Guardian view on school exclusions: the wrong answer It has taken a few years, but awareness of the rising number of pupils being excluded from English schools has grown to the point where the problem has become impossible to ignore. In the process, observers have become wiser to the methods used by schools seeking to expel awkward children without resorting to the formal last resort of permanent exclusion. Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman has made “off-rolling”, as such informal transfers are known, one of the key themes of her tenure. A year ago, the former children’s minister Edward Timpson was commissioned to produce a review of exclusions. The government has yet to publish this, no doubt because it makes uncomfortable reading for the Conservative politicians who bear ultimate responsibility for the state of England’s schools. New analysis showing that the number of primary-age pupils in pupil referral units (PRUs) doubled between 2011-18 to 1,572 is the latest troubling evidence of this unwelcome trend. The number of under-16s in alternative provision, including PRUs, stands at nearly 60,000. While most settings inspected by Ofsted are good or outstanding, there are places where all alternative provision is inadequate. Children with special educational needs, those who are poor, and ethnic minorities are over-represented. Teacher vacancies are uncomfortably high. Outcomes are poor. But raising the standard of alternative provision is only part of the answer. The point is that too many children are being shut out from the mainstream. Not every exclusion is wrong and schools must not be blamed for society’s ills. Some children, those with extremely difficult backgrounds or complex learning needs, are better off in specialist settings. For those in hospital, there is no practical alternative. Yet there is an argument made in defence of the status quo which is sterile and inhumane. It posits that the relationship between exclusions and outcomes such as involvement in knife crime is one of correlation, not causation, and that a rise in exclusions should not be regarded as a problem per se. This is wrong. An increasing rate of inclusion must be a goal of progressive policy-makers. If there is a silver lining, it is that the situation can no longer be ignored. Exclusions have become a relief valve for schools under pressure from league tables and as a result of cuts. Headteachers have shed learning mentors and teaching assistants. Councils have withdrawn educational psychologists and behavioural support teams. Last year the education select committee made some strong proposals – new rights for families, enforcement of the fair access protocol whereby pupils are reintegrated – as well as highlighting gaps that Mr Timpson’s report should fill. These include more detail on what kinds of schools are excluding what kinds of pupils. New incentives, though, will not mend what has been broken. If they do not come with the resources that make inclusive policies and lessons possible, the pressure will find another outlet – for example, in the continuing exodus of teachers. What is required is a new emphasis on values of supportiveness and cooperation between schools. It is a serious flaw of England’s deliberately fragmented school system that vulnerable children most easily fall through the cracks.",Opinion
"Saudi oil company named world's most profitable business Saudi Arabia’s state oil company has emerged as the most profitable business in the world, racking up profits of $111.1bn (£84.7bn) in 2018 to overtake Apple. According to a rare glimpse into its finances contained in a bond-offering document, Saudi Aramco made the profit on revenues of $355.9bn last year, as it produced 10.3m barrels per day of crude oil. The snapshot, published on Monday by the credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Services, places the company in a league above Apple, which made a profit of $59.5bn in 2018. It means the company made more than four times the profits of other oil industry rivals last year, including the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, which made $23bn, and the US firm Exxon Mobil, which made $21bn. The scale of Aramco dwarfs every other corporation in the world, but it is also among the most secretive, under the ownership of the Saudi state. It is the largest oil supplier on the planet and has exclusive access to nearly all of Saudi Arabia’s vast hydrocarbon reserves, which are among the world’s largest. The Gulf state had previously prepared the company for a stock market flotation that would have valued it at roughly $2tn, twice the value of Apple, but it then put the plan on hold last year. London had been a potential listing destination, although not without controversy as UK regulators said they would waive some corporate governance rules. The details of Aramco’s profits were disclosed as it looked to raise about $10bn from selling bonds to international investors to help fund the acquisition of its rival Sabic in a deal worth $69.1bn. Moody’s did not award the company the highest possible credit rating, of Aaa, citing its “close interlinkages” with Saudi Arabia, instead giving it an A1 rating, the same as the Saudi sovereign.",Business
"Leicester good enough to escape relegation battle, says Mike Ford Leicester’s new consultant, Mike Ford, believes the team have the talent and desire to escape the relegation scrap. The former England and Ireland defence coach has been hired for the remaining five matches of the season and following a run of eight defeats in 11 games that have dropped Leicester to 10th, five points above the bottom club, Newcastle, their opponents in the north-east next week. Before then, they face the leaders Exeter at Welford Road on Saturday. It was the 40-6 defeat at Sandy Park on the opening weekend of the season that prompted Leicester to sack coach Matt O’Connor. He was replaced by Geordan Murphy, initially on a caretaker basis, but their poor form on the road has continued. Three of Leicester’s matches are at home, where their record has been comparable to Harlequins, who are in fourth, three defeats and five victories. Their only away victory was at Twickenham in the east Midlands derby. “Nobody is in this position by choice,” said Ford after his first training session on Monday. “It is just a case of fine margins. The lack of confidence is huge and you get that back by training well. They are good enough players to recognise that and it was really good today in terms of energy, desire and fight. There was a great buzz, surprisingly. “I have come in to oversee things and help Geordan. It’s a lonely place at the head of a rugby club. I have been friends with Geordan for a long time and I can guide him.” Ford, a former Bath director of rugby who had a stint with Toulon, will link up again with his son, George, the England fly-half. He was linked with Leicester earlier in the season but attempts were being made then to end relegation, something the Premiership clubs now accept will not happen after opposition from Twickenham. Gavin Henson may have played his last professional game. The 37-year-old former Lion has been left out by the Dragons for their two Pro14 matches in South Africa this month and will not be offered a new contract. The Ireland flanker Dan Leavy will miss the World Cup after suffering a “complex” knee injury during Leinster’s European Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster. “Dan had a scan but he needs further assessment this week,” Leinster said in a statement. “He has been ruled out for the rest of the season and into the next one.”",Sport
"Stephen Moore: legal file on Trump Fed pick sealed after contempt revelations Legal filings detailing how Stephen Moore, Donald Trump’s pick for a Federal Reserve board seat, was found in contempt of court have been hidden from the public following a report by the Guardian. The entire file on Moore’s divorce was sealed by a court order on Monday in response to a request from Moore’s ex-wife, according to a clerk at Fairfax county circuit court in Virginia. CNBC first reported the file had been sealed. The Guardian disclosed on Saturday that Moore was found in contempt of court in November 2012 for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $300,000 in alimony, child support and debts from their 2011 divorce settlement. Documents from the file were copied by a Guardian reporter last week at the courthouse before the request to seal was made. The Guardian made the documents public on Monday. Trump has been criticised for picking Moore, an economics commentator who has worked for several conservative thinktanks and formerly wrote for the Wall Street Journal, to join the Federal Reserve’s board of governors. If Moore is formally nominated he must be confirmed by the US Senate. Greg Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard who was a senior economic adviser to the former president George W Bush, has said Moore “does not have the intellectual gravitas” for the job and urged senators to reject the nomination. After being found in contempt, Moore continued failing to pay, according to the court filings. This prompted the judge to order the sale of his house to satisfy the debt in 2013. But this process was halted by his ex-wife after Moore paid her about two-thirds of what he owed, a filing said. Moore, now 59, was also accused in the divorce complaint of inflicting “emotional and psychological abuse” on his ex-wife during their 20-year marriage and having affairs. The couple have three children together. Moore has since remarried. In a signed response from April 2011, Moore said that he “admits all allegations” in his ex-wife’s divorce complaint. Moore declined to comment last week when asked about the allegations. Moore told CNBC that the report on the legal dispute reinforced how “sleazy the media is resorting to tabloid journalism”. He said he did not expect the report to derail his nomination. Moore and his ex-wife, Allison, released statements through a spokeswoman on Monday. Moore said: “Allison Moore and I were married for 19 years and have three wonderful sons whom we have co-parented. Our divorce was settled amicably many years ago and we remain on friendly terms to this day. She is a terrific mother and I hold her in the highest regard. Allison, our kids and my current wife would hope that the media would please respect our privacy. I am happy to speak to the media on any matters related to the economy or my views on the Fed.” Allison Moore said: “Steve Moore and I reconciled through our divorce many years ago and we would hope the media would respect our privacy. We remain on cordial terms.”",Business
"Joe Biden: ex-defense secretary's wife says viral photo used 'misleadingly' As Joe Biden faces intense scrutiny of his behavior toward women, the wife of former defense secretary Ash Carter has dismissed claims a picture of her with the former vice-president is an example of unwanted touching. In a Medium post late on Sunday, Stephanie Carter discussed the photo, in which Biden has his hands on her shoulders and appears to be whispering in her ear during the swearing-in ceremony for her husband in 2015. “As the sole owner of my story,” Carter wrote, “it is high time that I reclaim it – from strangers, Twitter, the pundits and the late-night hosts. I won’t pretend that this will be the last of that picture, but it will be the last of other people speaking for me.” Biden, she said, had hugged her because he sensed she was “uncharacteristically nervous” and had leaned in to thank her for letting her husband serve in the Obama administration. He kept his hands on her shoulders “as a means of offering his support”, she wrote. Biden, 76, is mulling a third White House run and is widely reported to be close to announcing. Carter wrote her post days after Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state assemblywoman, wrote an essay for the Cut in which she recounted an encounter with Biden in 2014 that she said made her uncomfortable. Flores wrote that Biden touched her shoulders, leaned in to smell her hair and kissed the back of her head, conduct she found to be a violation of her personal space. On Sunday, asked about Biden’s presidential ambitions, Flores told CNN such behavior should be “disqualifying”. Biden issued a statement of his own, saying that in “many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.” Other Democratic presidential hopefuls expressed support for Flores. Aides to Donald Trump were critical of Biden’s behavior, their own boss’s vexed history of allegations of sexual misconduct notwithstanding. On Monday, a second woman said Biden had acted inappropriately, touching her face with both hands and rubbing noses with her in 2009. Amy Lappos, a former aide to the Democratic representative, Jim Hines of Connecticut, told the Associated Press that she and other Himes aides were helping at a fundraiser in a private home in Hartford in October 2009 when Biden entered the kitchen to thank the group. “After he finished speaking, he stopped to talk to us about how important a congressional staff is, which I thought was awesome.” Lappos, 43, said she was stunned as Biden moved toward her. “He wrapped both his hands around my face and pulled me in. I thought: ‘Oh, God, he’s going to kiss me.’ Instead, he rubbed noses with me.” She said Biden said nothing then moved off. The experience had left her feeling “weird and uncomfortable” and was “absolutely disrespectful of my personal boundaries”. Meanwhile a spokesman for Biden said photos purporting to show inappropriate behavior by the former vice-president were part of a smear campaign led by “rightwing trolls”. “These smears and forgeries have existed in the dark recesses of the internet for a while,” Bill Russo said. “And to this day, rightwing trolls and others continue to exploit them for their own gain.” Biden’s tendency to get close to women in public has long been dismissed as part of his friendly nature. But his behavior has come under renewed focus as a result of the #MeToo movement. Numerous photos have circulated in which he is seen with his arms around women’s waists or pulling them close and whispering. On Monday, Russo criticized the media for establishing a supposed pattern in Biden’s behavior by circulating images of his interactions with women without first confirming that the individuals in the photos were ever uncomfortable. Another widely shared image showed Biden leaning towards the 13-year-old daughter of the Delaware senator Chris Coons at his swearing-in ceremony in 2015 and kissing the side of her head. Coons told the Washington Post his family is extremely close to the Bidens, and that his children see the former vice-president as a grandfather figure. “She did not think of it as anything,” Coons said. “All three of my kids have known Joe their whole lives.” In her Medium post, Carter said the image in her case was “a still shot taken from a video – misleadingly extracted from what was a longer moment between close friends – sent out in a snarky tweet – came to be the lasting image of that day.” Carter also said Flores had the right to “speak her truth”. “She should be, like all women, believed,” Carter wrote. “But her story is not mine. The Joe Biden in my picture is a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful.”",US news
"Bob Higgins 'sexually assaulted youth player hundreds of times' A former youth footballer has told a jury that the ex-Southampton FC coach Bob Higgins sexually assaulted him hundreds of times starting when he was only 13. The player, who can only be identified as complainant X, said he feared that if he resisted, his chances of becoming a professional would be ruined and he was too embarrassed to confide to anyone what was happening. He told the jury that Higgins called him “son” and encouraged him to address him as: “Dad”. When the former player, who is now in his 50s, became an apprentice at Southampton, X inscribed the back of a picture of himself for Higgins with the message: “To my dad, from your everlasting son.” X also told the jury that other boys were encouraged to sit on Higgins’ lap and named the former Chelsea and England star Dennis Wise as one of these. There is no suggestion that Wise is a victim and he is not a complainant in the case. The prosecution at Bournemouth crown court has claimed that Higgins, 66, was a “predatory paedophile” who used his power as one of the sport’s “kingmakers” to carry out a 25-year campaign of sexual abuse against boys as young as 11. Higgins, 66, who also worked at Peterborough United and for the Maltese FA, as well as running his own football academy, denies 51 counts of indecent assault against 24 boys between the early 1970s and mid-1990s. The alleged assaults are said to have taken place in a variety of settings including training camps, Higgins’ home and his car. The jury has been told that the current proceedings are a retrial. Complainant X was a witness in last summer’s trial but said he he had felt too embarrassed to reveal what had allegedly happened to him then. He became emotional in the witness box when he explained that he had also feared his children could suffer if what he allegedly went through became public. But after giving evidence at last year’s trial, he decided that if anyone asked him again what had happened to him, he would reveal all. X told the court that he was spotted by Higgins aged 13. He went on to sign professionally for Southampton when he was 18, and after his release had a career in non-league football. While a youth player at Southampton, he told the court, he was “very, very close” to Higgins. “He wanted me to be around him,” he said. X said that shortly before he turned 14 Higgins took him on a trip to Sweden and on the voyage home touched him intimately. “I was in shock,” he said. Asked how long the incident had taken, he said: “It seemed like two years. I think it was about two minutes.” Over the next two years, X alleged the abuse escalated. He said he would stay at Higgins’ home. When his wife, Shirley, went to bed, they would touch themselves intimately in front of each other. X said this progressed to touching each other and then on to oral sex. Finally Higgins performed another sex act on him, X claimed. “I was in his power,” said X. “I had been caught up in something I couldn’t go back on … I wanted to please him. As a young lad, I was thinking about a career in football … It was a fear thing.” He said there were hundreds of sexual contacts. “It would make me feel angry at times,” he said. Asked why he called Higgins “dad” on the back of the picture, X said: “He was always calling me his son. One day he made the suggestion: ‘Why don’t you call me ‘Dad’?’ It was a strange thing to say.” The trial continues.",UK news
"Semi-naked climate protesters disrupt Brexit debate Semi-naked climate change protesters interrupted a House of Commons Brexit debate and glued their hands to the glass of the public gallery, spending almost 20 minutes with their buttocks facing the chamber. MPs attempted to continue the debate during the peaceful protest by 11 activists from Extinction Rebellion, though several made coded mentions to the protest in their speeches. Protesters had slogans daubed on their chests, including “for all life” and “SOS” and two more wore grey body paint and elephant masks, which the group said referred to climate change as “the elephant in the room”. Police cleared the public gallery in the House of Commons and then removed the protesters individually, some of whom were carried out by officers. The police later said 12 people had been arrested “for outraging public decency”. The protest began during a speech by the Labour MP Peter Kyle, who was arguing in favour of his motion to add a confirmatory Brexit referendum. The Tory MP Justine Greening congratulated Kyle for “fleshing out his arguments very well indeed” and Kyle in turn thanked the Conservative MP Steve Brine for a “cheeky intervention”. The Conservative Nick Boles congratulated Kyle for delivering his speech “with a certain amount of distraction” and quipped that many of his Tory colleagues appeared to be missing from the benches around him including “a noted naturist”. Boles was referring to the Brexiter MP Bernard Jenkin – who enjoys nudism as a private hobby. In a point of order, the Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the House of Commons had dealt well with “a distraction, not a disruption to our proceedings” and thanked thanked police and Commons officials. The Speaker, John Bercow, also thanked officials after the protesters were removed. “We just press on with the debate, that is what we are here to do,” he said, to cheers in the chamber. In a statement after the protest, one of the activists, Mark Ovland, said climate change was being “flagrantly and recklessly ignored by our government and media” and the group wanted to draw attention to the crisis during the debate on Brexit. “By undressing in parliament, we are putting ourselves in an incredibly vulnerable position, highlighting the vulnerability that all of us share in the face of environmental and societal breakdown,” he said. Another of the activists, Iggy Fox, said: “I’m tired of the time and resources our government wastes rearranging the deckchairs on the Brexitanic. It’s high time politicians stop beating around the bush and tackle the environmental crisis head on, like they should have done years ago. I won’t stop causing disruption until the government does its duty to protect the people from disaster.”",World news
"City watchdog told to review London Capital & Finance collapse The City watchdog has been ordered by the government to launch an independent review of how it handled the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance, the investment firm at the centre of a growing £236m financial scandal. LC&amp;F sold £236m worth of bonds which promised returns of 6.5% to 8% a year, but the company has collapsed with more than 11,000 investors expected to receive little more than a fifth of their money back. The board of the Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to subject itself to an independent investigation, which will examine the FCA’s supervision of LC&amp;F, and the regulation of the “mini-bonds” at the heart of the scandal. The independent person who will lead the process has not yet been appointed. Confirming that an investigation has been ordered by the government, the economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said: “The recent stories of those affected by the collapse of LC&amp;F are incredibly concerning. I want to make sure we have the strongest and safest financial system possible. By ordering this investigation, we will better understand the circumstances around the collapse and make sure we are properly protecting those who invest their money in the future.” The investigation could prove deeply embarrassing for the regulator after it emerged that the FCA’s enforcement team were warned three years ago about LC&amp;F but failed to act. It may also throw a lifeline to the victims of the collapse – some of whom sunk their entire pensions into the scheme – who currently have no recourse to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. A spokeswoman for a Facebook group representing the bond investors said: “We see this as the power of the collective voice raising concerns and excellent news. We hope that we will be able to provide impact statements.” She said some investors had lost six figure sums. The review follows a demand by Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury select committee. She said: “The FCA and the Treasury must think innovatively about how the investigation can report and publish as quickly as possible. Investors will want answers. LC&amp;F is also under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office which two weeks ago arrested and later released four individuals in the Kent and Sussex area as part of its probe. The LC&amp;F products were structured as “mini-bonds” that carry zero protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, but which have in recent years been heavily promoted to investors. The investigation will determine if mini-bonds should come under the supervision of the FCA – and maybe also qualify for protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The bonds on offer from LC&amp;F were marketed heavily during 2016 and 2017 with the promise of interest at a table-topping 6.5% to 8%. LC&amp;F became an FCA-regulated entity on 7 June 2016, and was granted tax-free ISA status by HMRC. But little of the money ploughed into the bonds by investors went into safe interest-bearing investments. About £58m was taken as commission by the Brighton-based marketing company, Surge Financial, which promoted the bonds. As the administrators set out in clinical detail last week, much of the rest went into highly speculative property developments, some in the Dominican Republic, oil exploration off the Faroe Islands, and even a helicopter bought for a company controlled by LC&amp;F. It was not until 10 December 2018 that the FCA ordered LC&amp;F to stop promoting the bonds because it deemed the investments ineligible for ISAs – which allow savers to shelter up to £20,000 a year from tax – and on 13 December froze its assets because of “serious concerns about the way the firm was conducting its business”. In a report last month the administrators Smith &amp; Williamson said: “There are a number of highly suspicious transactions involving a small group of connected people which have led to large sums of bondholders’ money ending up in their personal possession or control.” The Yorkshire-based financial adviser Neil Liversidge was an early whistleblower about LC&amp;F after a client asked his advice. He wrote to the client saying underlying investments in the bond were worth “the square root of bugger all” and immediately contacted the FCA with his concerns. In a letter to the FCA dated 29 November 2015 – before the bulk of investors had placed their money with LC&amp;F – Liversidge called the bond’s promoters unprofessional, and the investment unsuitable. “This promotion gives me cause for concern as to how safe or otherwise will be any funds placed with them.” The FCA did not respond. The only previous time that the FCA has subjected itself to an independent external investigation followed the Cooperative Bank scandal. The role of HMRC in granting ISA status is also likely to come under the spotlight. In their report, the administrators said: “Our understanding is that the necessary requirements to qualify for ISA manager status are fairly limited and that it is not a rigorous application process. We understand that ISA managers are not routinely monitored by HMRC.” HMRC said it does not approve any ISA investment that an ISA manager may offer.",Business
"Poorer than George Clooney? How you spend your money still sends a message Elton John has joined George Clooney in calling for a boycott of nine Brunei-owned luxury hotels – including the Dorchester, London and the Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles – over the sultanate’s new anti-LGBT laws. The law is horrific – Brunei is due to impose death by stoning as a punishment for gay sex, as well as adultery, from this week. As Clooney said, every time people use the hotels, “we are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens for being gay or accused of adultery”. Whether or not to stay at the Dorchester is not a dilemma many of us face, but the problem of whether to avoid companies with questionable practices is a growing one. Amazon has been shunned by some shoppers over its tax avoidance, while Waterstones is now in the press for not paying staff a living wage. Spending is not just about the product on offer but whom – and what – we are supporting. We might avoid that holiday in Dubai, due to the hidden slavery that built the luxury, or Topshop in light of its owner Philip Green’s harassment allegations. But unless we take ourselves to live off-grid in the mountains, we all have to navigate ethics within a capitalist and unjust system. I am aware of the human cost of making my smartphone, but I am not sure how I would do my job without one. There is also a certain amount of privilege involved here. Clooney will be welcome in any other hotel, but if you are on a low income, or if disability means you struggle to scour local shops, it is not so easy to avoid a site such as Amazon. Still, withholding our business when we are able gives us the chance to flex our power. If “money talks”, we should think about what we are really saying when we spend it.",Opinion
"Five ways to start doing squats safely Warming up is key “Going straight into squats, particularly if you have a sedentary job and therefore tight hip flexors and inactive glutes, can be a recipe for disaster,” warns Fran Whitfield, head trainer at F45 Vauxhall, a central London gym. She advises targeting the ankles, hamstrings, adductors, hip flexors and glutes in the warm-up. Laura Jamieson, a physiotherapist, suggests two to five minutes on a rowing machine: “This is good for squats as it requires the same explosive power through the legs.” Yoga movements such as the Z sit and the lizard and pigeon poses are also options to try, as well as bridges, side planks and clams. Both Whitfield and Jamieson advise working up to using a resistance band for more glute activation. Master the basics Although correct technique can differ slightly by type of squat, Ben West, a personal trainer and ambassador for Science in Sport, a sports nutrition company, says to keep the feet symmetrical; mimic sitting down on a low chair when initiating the squat; and resist any flaring of the ribcage when driving back up. The NHS guide to squats describes correct posture. Don’t go too heavy too soon A common mistake beginners make is starting with too heavy a weight. “Leave the ego at the door and start with a weight that ensures your form is perfect first,” says Whitfield. Jamieson recommends only increasing weights by five to 10kg to maintain technique. If you find you can no longer control your movement or form, such as not being able to stop your knees from collapsing in, reduce the weight. Vary your stance – and your weight A 2018 study examining different squat stances concluded that extremely wide or narrow stances should be avoided due to the large movements of the knees and hips required. Standing with feet shoulder width apart and feet angled at 20° was recommended, but the paper’s author, Silvio Lorenzetti, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Sport Magglingen, stresses the importance of switching it up from time to time so as to train different parts of the muscles. “If your goal is to build strength, you should be working on fewer repetitions with more weight,” says West. “If your goal is performance-based you may want to add less weight and work on pushing out of the squat with more force and speed.” Ditch the running shoes “Do not wear spongy, soft trainers that will rock and move when you are squatting,” says Jamieson. She advises weightlifting shoes that have a hard platform and a heel raise. Whitfield agrees that specialist shoes will provide support, stability and increased ankle mobility. “You want to achieve the most stable base for yourself and performing the movement in running trainers, which have a padded sole, heel and lots of flexibility, will limit your ability to ground your weight.”",Life and style
"Government spends £5.5m in a month on Brexit consultants The government spent £5.5m in a single month on management consultants to help with Brexit policy, it has emerged. Labour analysed government data on all spending of £25,000 or more in January, the last month for which figures have been released, and calculated that the amount spent on external consultants for Brexit-related work was £6m. The Cabinet Office, the department which organises such cross-departmental spending, said just over £400,000 of this was spent not on consultants but by a media buying company to purchase advertising space for the government’s Brexit-related public information campaign. It said the £5.5m, which primarily went to multinational companies including EY, PwC and Bain, covered necessary extra skills for Brexit-related tasks such as operational and project management tasks. The monthly cost was expected to increase as the Brexit process accelerated, the department said. At the end of last year the Treasury said it had allocated £4.2bn for government spending on Brexit preparations. At the weekend the Centre for European Reform released calculations suggesting Britain’s economy is 2.5% smaller than it would have been if voters had chosen to stay in the EU in 2016, resulting in an extra £19bn of government borrowing a year. Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, said: “The Tories’ handling of Brexit is a national embarrassment. While the prime minister is stubbornly refusing to accept her bad deal is dead, we now learn her government spent millions of pounds on private consultants in the same month it suffered the biggest defeat in parliamentary history. This underlines the importance of parliament taking control and finding a way to break the deadlock.” A Cabinet Office spokesman said: “It is long-established practice for government departments to draw on the advice of external specialists. In preparing for the UK to make an orderly and successful exit from the European Union, we are equipping ourselves with the right people and the right skills.” • This article was amended on 2 April 2019. The £5.5m was spending on consultants across government, not just by the Cabinet Office as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",Politics
"British MEP stripped of parliament role over Gibraltar 'colony' spat A British MEP who challenged Spain’s description of Gibraltar as a colony has accused his opponents of “dirty tricks” after he was stripped of a key position in the European parliament. Claude Moraes was forced out of the role of rapporteur for EU no-deal visa-free travel legislation, a position in which his job is to represent MEPs’ views, after he refused to accept the contentious description of the British overseas territory in a draft law. The two largest groups in the European parliament – the centre-right European People’s Party and the Socialists &amp; Democrats – forced through his removal at a hearing on Monday on the grounds of a conflict of interest. Spain, with whom Britain has clashed over the sovereignty of Gibraltar for three centuries, had argued for the description of Gibraltar as a “colony of the British crown” in legislation, with the backing of the other 26 member states. The draft law was first put to a vote by MEPs six weeks ago. The draft law was held up owing to Moraes’s refusal to give ground on the issue. He said he had no mandate to accept what he said was an erroneous description. Gibraltar voted to remain British sovereign territory in a referendum in 2002. The two main political groups in the parliament said Moraes’s removal was necessary as parliament needed to ensure visa-free travel for EU and British nationals in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 12 April, the new cliff-edge date after the mini-extension of article 50 agreed by the EU leaders. Moraes, an MEP of 20 years, said he was pleased that colleagues outside the two main groups had expressed their vehement opposition to his unseating as rapporteur. “This denigrates the parliament, it denigrates the UK’s position in the parliament,” Moraes said. “They said that we need visa-free legislation, but that was not the problem as we had come forward with a range of compromise wording for Gibraltar. It is pretty dirty politics.” He added: “It shows Britain’s weakness today. This is how they were able to do it. I am pleased that I did not buckle and give up. In future, others in this position, if their home country is in a weakened position, should not give up either. “Despite all the various compromise proposals from us, we have been met with something of a brick wall … due, we believe, to Spain lobbying hard for the maintenance of the word ‘colony’ in the footnote.” At Monday’s hearing, fellow MEPs, in six other political party groups, argued against what they described as an unconstitutional act. Sophie in ’t Veld, a Dutch MEP and deputy leader of the Liberal group, described Moraes’s removal as unprecedented. Petr Ježek, a liberal Czech MEP, said: “I disassociate myself with this process and consider it scandalous that such a decision has been taken purely on the basis of the nationality and therefore the assumed bias of the rapporteur.”",World news
"Bookmakers accused of bypassing FOBT rules with roulette-style games Bookmakers have been accused of trying to cheat rules curbing fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) after a Guardian investigation found high-stakes roulette-style games being launched on the same day restrictions on the machines came into force. A reduction in FOBT stakes from £100 to £2 was introduced on Monday, after the government branded them a “social blight” following a long-running campaign highlighting huge losses suffered by gamblers, some of them addicts. But less than 48 hours after the industry regulator warned bookmakers against trying to bypass the law, high street firms were accused of doing just that. The Gambling Commission said on Monday it was investigating the new products. The new games launched by bookmakers Betfred and Paddy Power prompted condemnation from campaigners, former sports minister Tracey Crouch and Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson, who branded them “FOBTs by the back door”. William Hill is planning a similar product but has yet to launch it. Sports minister Mims Davies said: “We cut FOBT stakes to £2 to protect vulnerable people from gambling-related harm, and operators should respect both the letter and the spirit of that change. “We are watching very closely to see how the industry reacts to this measure and will not hesitate to act if we see evidence of harm.” Betfred began offering a roulette-style game on Monday, even as restrictions on FOBTs were imposed despite vociferous lobbying by bookmakers, who warned 4,500 stores could close at the cost of 21,000 jobs. The game, called Virtual Cycling, allows gamblers to place bets on a piece of paper obtained over the counter, showing a graphic similar to a roulette table. The game features a maximum stake of £500, five times what was possible on the FOBT games that are now banned. Players bet on when an animated cyclist travelling around a track will be overtaken by virtual competitors, based on numbers corresponding to sections of the track. A spokesman for Betfred said: “Bets for all these products need to be filled out on a betting slip and handed over at the counter, where our staff can interact with the customers as they do so. These are not machine games but over-the-counter bets.” The numbers from 1 to 36 echo those featured on a roulette wheel, as does the opportunity to bet on odd or even and groups of numbers. An employee in one Betfred outlet told The Guardian: “It just came in this morning. It really reminds you of roulette.” Paddy Power’s game is called Pick ‘n’ 36 and features a maximum stake of £100, the same level as FOBTs before the new restrictions. Like Betfred’s Virtual Cycling game, players bet on numbers between 1 and 36, as well as on other eventualities similar to roulette. A TV screen displays “hot” and “cold” numbers, giving the impression that the numbers selected are not random – a feature heavily criticised by the GambleAware charity. A staff member in a Paddy Power branch described the game as the “new roulette” and said it had been on trial in several of the company’s 320 stores from Monday. While the stakes are as high as FOBTs, the games are less frequent, running once every three minutes, compared to once every 20 seconds. The Guardian has approached Paddy Power for comment. William Hill is testing a game called Wonderball, which will allow customers to stake up to £50 by filling in boxes on a printed roulette board. A draw then takes place on TV screens, with prizes of up to £25,000 available. A betting slip, which will be handed out to customers if the game is launched nationwide, describes it as a “fixed odds betting event”. “It’s just like roulette but the spin is on the TV screen,” an employee in a William Hill shop told the Guardian, adding that the game was not yet available but was likely to be launched soon. A William Hill spokesman said: “We are committed to player protection under our ‘nobody harmed’ ambition and any product we may choose to launch will be fully assessed from this standpoint and will only be launched after full engagement with the regulator.” All of the games technically comply with FOBT laws, which cover £100-a-spin roulette on self-service machines. But MPs and campaigners lined up to criticise bookmakers for apparently seeking to circumvent the spirit of the rules. Labour’s shadow culture minister, Tom Watson, said: “These new games seem like FOBTs by the back door and look like a pretty disgraceful example of bad faith by the bookmakers involved. They appear to be trying to cheat the system. “The gambling industry fought FOBTs reform tooth and nail, never accepting the terrible social harm they caused. They clearly haven’t learned any lessons – if they won’t reform themselves a Labour government is determined to do it for them.” Tracey Crouch MP, who resigned as sports minister in anger at a proposed delay to FOBT curbs, said: “Any attempts to circumnavigate measures that reduce harm would be morally irresponsible. If bookmakers had taken their responsibilities for player protection more seriously there wouldn’t have been a need for government or regulator intervention.” Helen Venn, executive director at the Gambling Commission, said: “We are aware of these products and we are investigating. We have been extremely clear about our expectations in relation to how operators should implement the stake reduction. This is why we have been monitoring developments closely and last week we wrote to operators to remind them of their responsibilities to ensure consumers are protected. Where we see businesses failing to act responsibly in response to the stake reduction we will not hesitate to step in.’’",UK news
"'Morally subterranean': John Oliver slams WWE for treatment of wrestlers As the news cycle continues to orbit around politics and primaries, John Oliver turned to a less scrutinized though still wildly popular topic: World Wrestling Entertainment, commonly known as WWE. WWE is “astonishingly popular”, said Oliver on Last Week Tonight, with over one billion fans on social media, two highly rated cable shows, a streaming network, multiple reality show spinoffs and an in-house movie studio responsible for at least six films under the title The Marine. And it’s profitable – it made over $930m last year, and its flagship event, WrestleMania, is worth more than the World Series. That comparison “actually makes sense, when you think about it”, Oliver said, “because while the World Series is mostly spent watching a millionaire in a button-down think about whether or not to throw a ball”, WrestleMania features people falling off a cage, “exploding through a table”, or spraying someone with a giant milk hose. But Oliver argued for looking into the WWE due to a disturbing trend of early deaths among its wrestlers. He pointed to a study by FiveThirtyEight comparing project lifespans for average men, NFL players and WWE wrestlers; the wrestlers’ death rate line on the graph was so much higher that “you’d expect that line to be labeled ‘test pilots who lied on their resume,’ or ‘zookeepers who aren’t just going to let some fucking baboon screech at them like that.’” Given that startling data, Oliver sought to turn Last Week Tonight’s scorching beam on WWE and how it treats its wrestlers. For starters, Oliver said: “You can’t talk about the WWE without talking about its chairman and CEO, Vince McMahon,” seen in a magazine photo shoot shirtless, styled as “scary grandpa who looks like big, bumpy hotdog”, and bearing a giant chain around his neck. McMahon bought the company from his dad and through the 1980s and 90s, consolidated and absorbed individual and regional wrestling leagues until WWE became “one giant company that basically holds a monopoly on the industry”. Oliver continued that “it’s impossible to overstate just how involved Vince is” in WWE – he oversees storylines, scripts and plays a fictional, villainous version of himself – but “the shocking thing about McMahon and his company is the extent to which he has shielded himself from responsibility for his wrestlers’ welfare”. For example, McMahons’ wrestlers aren’t technically his employees; they’re still considered “independent contractors” despite signing exclusive contracts and providing the wellspring for McMahon’s entire business. There’s also no off-season, and glimpses of wrestlers’ contracts, provided by Last Week Tonight, revealed some “astonishing clauses”, such as the right for WWE to terminate a contract if a wrestler is sidelined by an injury for as little as six weeks, or waiving the league’s responsibility for injury or death even if it’s “caused by negligence of promoter”. Oliver conceded that the league has taken positive steps in the past few years, such as banning chair shots to the head. Its “talent wellness program” now includes “annual physical examinations”, though Oliver pointed out that “that’s just nothing. I have to take one of those every year to host this show and I’ve never once exploded through this table.” All of this shadiness brought up an important question for Oliver: is there any hope here? “Well, incredibly, there might be, because there’s one group that even McMahon occasionally seems to listen to, and that’s the fans.” He pointed to successful fan campaigns to include more female wrestlers and resist making Roman Reigns the franchise successor to The Rock, even booing him for 8 minutes straight (“you may think that’s harsh, but I’d argue that’s the only rational response to someone with permanently wet hair,” Oliver quipped). Fans have even fronted several GoFundMe campaigns for wrestlers’ medical or funeral expenses, “which is heartwarming, but frankly, fans shouldn’t be the ones shouldering that responsibility” for a league that does not provide its stars adequate healthcare or compensation for the long-term consequences of professional wrestling. “Here’s how bad it is: even the NFL, for all its massive faults, now offers players health reimbursement accounts and have established a legacy fund for older players who may be dealing with health issues,” Oliver said. “And when you’ve lost the moral high ground to the fucking NFL, you’re morally subterranean.” Oliver then called on WWE fans to leverage their influence next week at WrestleMania, where the mic-ed crowd will have a live platform to, say, call for better healthcare. “I’m not saying the fans should do that, or make signs, or make lots of signs,” Oliver said, “I’m just saying I really hope they make their voices heard on this.” “Because given that Business Hulk here,” referring to Vince McMahon, “is a billionaire on the broken backs of his non-employees, the very least he could do is show the same dedication to wrestlers that they have shown to his company”.",Culture
"Murray-Darling water plan: Labor says it's prepared to override states The ALP is preparing to use federal powers under the Water Act and its influence with the two Labor-controlled basin states to drive better environmental outcomes if it wins government in May. The opposition spokesman on the environment and water, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia he would immediately convene the ministerial council and outline what he wants to achieve. “If the states refuse to cooperate, I will look at powers in the Water Act,” he said. So far the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) has not used all its powers, preferring to work collaboratively with the states. However the act gives the MDBA the authority to take over the planning powers of the states in relation to the river system as well as allowing a greater role in enforcement. Since Guardian Australia investigated the Murray-Darling in March 2018, the health of Australia’s greatest river system, and the $13bn plan to save it, have been thrust into the centre of the national political debate. The drought that began to unfold in early 2018 has become prolonged and highlighted inadequacies in the plan. The most dramatic warning has been the deaths of hundreds of thousands of fish at Menindee. The deaths of 40- and 50-year-old Murray cod, which survived the millennium drought of the early 2000s but perished this time around, horrified Australians and raised serious questions about the management of the river. There are now marked policy differences between the Coalition and Labor at state and federal level over what should happen next under the plan, though both major parties remain committed to retaining the plan itself. The question is: can the basin plan be reformed – and the remaining $4.5bn be spent constructively – without the key stakeholder states and the farming lobby pulling out of the plan? A bare-minimum plan The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has warned from the outset that the environmental water recovery target of 2750GL in the plan was a political compromise and is a bare minimum to restore the health of the Murray-Darling River. Since then, serious management failures have led to a systematic weakening of reforms and undermining of the plan, they say. “Without major changes in implementation, it is almost certain that the basin plan will fail,” the group has warned in numerous submissions. The group’s spokesman, Prof Jamie Pittock, said there have been improvements in enforcement in New South Wales after the ABC Four Corners report in July 2017, which sounded the alarm over allegations of water theft by cotton irrigators in the north of NSW. But he said: “The major part of the problem – bad rules in water-sharing plans – remain. NSW and Victoria haven’t changed their attitude towards fixing them.” Inquiries point in the same direction The most scathing and comprehensive criticism of the basin plan was delivered in February by a South Australian royal commission. It found officials at the MDBA and in government were guilty of maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in drawing up the multibillion-dollar deal to save Australia’s largest river system. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, warned the plan’s failure to take account of climate change was “potentially catastrophic”. While the Morrison government and the MDBA dismissed the findings (they had refused to participate in the inquiry) the royal commission heard from many of the leading scientists in the field. There was a distressing consensus in their assessments. Many of its findings were backed up by the Productivity Commission’s five-year review, albeit in more temperate, bureaucratic language. “Deficiencies in the way that governments have approached implementation of the plan have caused considerable concern in many basin communities. This has left a legacy of community distrust, which the commission considers is a risk to effectively implementing the next phase of the plan,” it said. In the fine print, it noted the poor enforcement by states, that new plans to deliver on water sharing were way behind schedule, that programs to find water savings in other ways were highly ambitious and risky, and the MDBA’s evaluation frameworks were inadequate. Then there were two reports – by the Academy of Science commissioned by Labor, and the Vertessy report commissioned by the government – in the wake of the fish kills. Both concluded that low flows had been responsible for the conditions that led to the mass deaths. Australian National University professor and chairman of the Academy of Science’s panel, Craig Moritz, said his review found “there isn’t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes”. “This is partly due to the ongoing drought. However, analysis of rainfall and river flow data over decades points to excess water extraction upstream,” he said. A common theme in all of these reports is that flows in the northern part of the system are dramatically reduced compared with historical records, and it cannot be explained solely by drought. The likely causes are climate change, which is changing rainfall patterns, and overextraction by irrigators – possibly in breach of the rules and floodplain harvesting, which involves diverting overland flows into private storages before it even reaches the river. A study by the MDBA identified the problem. From 1990 to 2017, a period which covered the millennium drought, “Some individual flow events in the post-2000 period were seen to be very heavily attenuated in both the Collarenebri-to-Walgett and (particularly) the Walgett-to-Brewarrina reaches, contrary to the established pre-2000 trend,” the study said. In other words, too much water was being diverted from the river. But facing up to this new reality is proving difficult. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists argue that the plan can be salvaged but requires governments and regulators to recognise its weaknesses and put the environmental objectives of the plan ahead of politics. One step forward, two back Over the past 12 months, there have been developments that are both positive and negative. In the wake of the fish kills, Labor, Greens and minor parties joined forces to make one important change: an amendment that will lift the cap of 1500GL on water that can be bought back from farmers. The cap had been put in place by the Abbott government in 2015 under pressure from the Nationals who feared the economic impact of more buybacks on rural communities. But the change will only be relevant if the government of the day calls more tenders to buy back water or if other measures to reclaim water for the environment, such as the supply projects like Menindee Lakes are unsuccessful, forcing a government’s hand. Burke said the cap on buybacks was never part of the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan. “By removing the cap on buybacks, Labor is removing a legislative barrier to providing more water for the basin, if that is what is needed,” he said. The more serious threats to realising the environmental outcomes are two amendments to the plan, supported by the government and opposition, which reduce the amount of water available for the environment. The plan always envisaged there could be changes, but the two changes – a 70GL cut to the environmental water target in the northern basin and agreement to allow 605GL of water to be recovered in the southern basin through efficiency projects – are controversial. Both have drawn almost universal criticism from scientists but were supported by the MDBA and by both major parties. The 70GL is a straight cut that reduces the environmental water recovery target by about 31,000 Olympic swimming pools. “I guess I was surprised by the figure. But the reality is the plan falls over if you do not support the independent process,” Burke said, explaining his decision to support the government. But since the Menindee fish deaths, he said he would “not be surprised if MDBA review the 70GL cut”. The 605GL adjustment in the southern basin is more complex. The idea is that environmental outcomes equivalent to this amount of flows can be achieved by using water more efficiently often through building river infrastructure or removing it. The problem is knowing whether the projects will work. The Productivity Commission described the supply measures projects, as they are known, as “highly ambitious” and rated the risk of failure as “high”. The Menindee Lakes project, to reduce evaporation by shrinking the lake system, is a case in point. If the project fails to deliver on its 105GL of evaporation savings, it will mean a shortfall in environmental water that needs to be made in 2024. Then there is the glacial progress by the states in implementing key commitments under the plan. NSW has been slow on its new water resource plans, leaving in place old plans like the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan, which have been roundly criticised for allowing pumping by irrigators during low flows at the expense of the environment. Victoria is under fire for its failure to remove or rebuild bridges and roads and other assets that currently prevent the commonwealth environmental water holder from flooding the upper flood plains, which is critical for endangered ecosystems such as red gum forests. “If I win the election, I would want to get the ministerial council together as quickly as possible,” said Burke. “One of the things we need is a clear work plan for constraints removal, particularly in Victoria. “I am determined that I will get constraints removed and I am frustrated by the lack of progress. I would prefer a consensus approach but failure to remove them is not an option.” Burke said he also expected the states to take notice that water-sharing plans underpin the reforms and there will be “no tolerance” for plans that subvert them.",Environment
"A-League contenders – who has made the grade so far? After a heavy 4-1 defeat in Wellington last weekend, the Newcastle Jets’ outside chances at a finals run are effectively over and this season’s championship contenders are locked in. But with a post-season system that rewards over half the teams in the league, which of the six have really earned their place? Flying colours – Perth Glory Under-praised by the east coast papers, Perth Glory are the story of 2018-19 and Tony Popovic is the coach of the season. A club that has been over-reliant on the twin talents of Andy Keogh and Diego Castro, Perth have transformed overnight from a band of plucky scrappers to a team with the genuine depth and strength of squad to win a premiership. Injury-plagued seasons for Matt Spiranovic, Tomi Mrcela and Alex Grant have not undermined their defence – 36-year-old Dino Djulbic wouldn’t have expected 17 starts, but he’s just one of several squad players who have proven integral to Perth’s success. At the other end, Chris Ikonomidis has added explosive talent and energy to free the ageing legs of Castro, and four 90-plus minute goals are testament to his fitness and the team’s never-say-die attitude. Strengths: Numerically the best defence and attack in the league, Perth are a complete team, with excellent performers across the XI. They have quality delivery from wide areas, creativity from Castro and, in Neil Kilkenny and Juande, they boast the league’s pre-eminent midfield duo. Weaknesses: Few. Nobody has yet found a way to come to grips with Popovic’s 5-3-2 system – only a relative lack of grand final experience could cost them against nearest rivals Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC. Exceeded expectations – Wellington Phoenix A Newcastle Jets 2017-18-style fairytale, the Phoenix’s resurgence under Mark Rudan has deep and manifold roots. Never has the Kiwi club provided two of the league’s top five goalscorers, but anyone surprised by Roy Krishna’s tally this season simply hasn’t watched the Nix closely. The Fijian’s blistering pace and strength despite his frame has been a constant feature of recent campaigns – the outlier is not that he’s scoring goals again under Rudan, but rather that he scored so few under Darije Kalezić. With a strong spine led by visa signings Filip Kurto, Steven Taylor and Mandi, it’s the fringe players that have blossomed this season. After almost two years ravaged by injury Louis Fenton has been a revelation. Delivering on the promise he’s long hinted at, Alex Rufer has improved dramatically, but it’s the emergence of youngsters Sarpreet Singh and Libby Cacace that’s a testament to the club’s investment in its academy – and former youth coach Andy Hedge and current first-team assistant Chris Greenacre. Strengths: Rudan called them the “best striking combination in the league” and when Krishna has his tail up and David Williams fires they’re lethal. Rudan has them defensively resolute and explosive on the counter, but the biggest strength is a wave of positive momentum and a feeling that the shackles are finally off. Weaknesses: With only one win from eight against the teams above them, Nix have been flat-track bullies and don’t have the depth to match teams like Perth. The loss of Fenton on the weekend robs them of a key cog in their system, and they can struggle when teams force them to make the play. Pass with some merit – Melbourne Victory For a half against Western Sydney Wanderers in round six, Victory played some of the most scintillating stuff the A-League has ever seen – it was liquid football. Victory’s world-class recruits, Keisuke Honda and Ola Toivonen, supported by Kosta Barbarouses and Terry Antonis, exploded with purpose, and for a brief moment the league looked theirs for the storming. But they’ve failed to replicate that consistently. Toivonen’s sublime free-kicks have delivered, as has Honda’s general sophistry, but when the star recruits have been unavailable the play has too often been pedestrian. Central defence has been an issue, and often, as against Perth, only the heroics of Lawrence Thomas have saved the backline’s blushes. Strengths: Despite their season-long shortcomings, under Kevin Muscat you’re always guaranteed mongrel, and Victory remain brimming with big game performers: see last year’s grand final. Weaknesses: Pace and balance in midfield. James Troisi has shone episodically but at times the dynamic is all wrong with Victory overrun or shown to lack pace or industry – especially compared with Perth or Sydney’s engine rooms. Pass with some merit – Sydney FC It seems churlish to suggest that a side sitting second on the table has under-delivered, but such was the level of performance we had come to expect from Sydney FC in recent campaigns there is the faintest whiff of vulnerability about Steve Corica’s team. Shock losses to Brisbane Roar and a then-struggling Wellington have pierced the air of invincibility, and a third loss to Melbourne Victory next weekend would definitely suggest a mental edge for Muscat’s men. Like Wellington, it’s hard not to view Sydney in contrast to the season that has gone before – for all Adam Le Fondre’s obvious quality, there’s the lingering ghost of a departed 27-goal striker hanging over this team, and what has come in has not replaced what has departed. Injury-free Siem de Jong hasn’t sparkled alongside Miloš Ninković like Adrian Mierzejewski did, and highly rated midfield creators Danny De Silva and Anthony Caceres have seen limited minutes. Strengths: The core of this team remains high quality – Ninković the creator, Rhyan Grant and Michael Zullo remain the best wide defensive duo, Brandon O’Neill and Josh Brillante remain a match-winning platform. Weaknesses: Le Fondre has oozed quality, but outside Ninković Sydney have struggled for a second creative outlet. Alex Wilkinson has toiled reliably but there’s a Jordy Buijs-sized hole alongside him. Concessional pass – Adelaide United There was a sense early in the season that when the Reds got all their troops on the park something very special could come together. The addition of Ben Halloran and Craig Goodwin brought top-end A-League quality and at the back Michael Jakobsen has been instrumental to making Adelaide as parsimonious as Marco Kurz no doubt likes. To have a marquee striker reduced to just 22 minutes is a catastrophe for any side – even Ross McCormack, who departed after five rounds, gave Central Coast more than Baba Diawara has provided Adelaide this season – but visa recruits like Jordy Thomassen, Ken Ilsø, even Mirko Boland, simply haven’t brought enough to the competition. Kurz’s side isn’t scoring goals – the Reds boast just one more than the Mariners and are the only finals team to have scored fewer at this stage of the season was his Adelaide side from last season. Strengths: Very solid. Paul Izzo is a safe set of hands (and feet) and the Reds are always defensively compact. Ryan Strain continues as one of the league’s most improved young players. Weaknesses: Outside of Isaías, the flair is waning in Adelaide with Kurz’s preference for industry over guile at times stultifying. They don’t have a No 9 to spearhead the attack and with the exception of Goodwin the threat from wide areas has diminished remarkably in recent months. Fail – Melbourne City If ever there’s been an advertisement for a reduced finals series it is Warren Joyce’s Melbourne City. With the facilities, youth investment and squad experience at his disposal, what has been served up on a regular basis leaves the club vulnerable to accusations that winning football games simply isn’t a priority. Established Australian pros look like they’re simply cashing paychecks, visa signings such as Michael O’Halloran and Florin Berenguer have been huge disappointments, and young talents like Lachlan Wales or even Riley McGree have failed to progress in this environment. As Jonathan Howcroft’s excellent column surmises: “The club began with a Heart – in name at least – but has always struggled to locate its soul.” Strengths: Despite the handwringing, City still possess genuine match winners – Ritchie De Laet, Jamie Maclaren, Luke Brattan, even McGree if Joyce could find a role for him to excel in. Despite the gloom a finals run isn’t out of the question if the big players stand tall. Weaknesses: Motivation. Four clubs have had horror seasons – and City have lost to all four of them. Fans don’t want to be there, players don’t want to be there. Why are we doing this?",Football
"Australian Super Rugby teams show both sides of player rotation policy Australia’s decision to mimic New Zealand’s policy of resting Test players for Super Rugby games to ensure they are fit and fresh for this year’s World Cup is a vexed issue, and results at the weekend demonstrated there is a right way and a wrong way for clubs to rotate their squads. The NSW Waratahs’ decision to rest five-eighth Bernard Foley, outside-centre Adam Ashley-Cooper and back-rower Jack Dempsey against the Japanese Sunwolves backfired dramatically with a 31-29 defeat. The Waratahs fully expected to beat the Sunwolves without their Wallabies trio, but they did not see the banana skin on the Pacific Highway as they drove to Newcastle. The Sunwolves were unlucky not to beat the Waratahs in Tokyo a few weeks earlier and had also won their first away game when they defeated the Chiefs in Hamilton. They should not have been taken so lightly. Losing to the Sunwolves at home will harm the Waratahs’ chances of winning the Australian conference and securing a home final. It will also further disgruntle already disillusioned fans: a team should never ever rest star players in a home game because it robs the fans who turn up to support them. You can’t ask your own fans to pay for steak and serve hamburger. Friday’s match was the Waratahs’ first home game played outside Sydney and fans would have walked away feeling disappointed and even a little bit cheated. Conversely, the Melbourne Rebels showed great smarts when they rested three of their own Wallabies – halfback Will Genia, second-rower Adam Coleman and winger Marika Koroibete as well as Wallaby-in-waiting Isi Naisarani – from their match with the Sharks in Durban a week ago. The Rebels have never won a game in South Africa and were unlikely to beat the Sharks. They sacrificed a game they probably were not going to win anyway to give themselves the best chance of beating the Queensland Reds in Brisbane last Saturday night. It was clever management of the rotation policy. The Rebels’ 32-13 away win over the Reds has put the Melbourne side back on top of the Australian conference table and will enhance their chances of securing an automatic playoff berth. Beating a team in the same conference is virtually worth twice the competition points, while losing to a fellow conference team is like receiving double demerit points. There is speculation the Waratahs will rest players when they play back-to-back matches with the Bulls and Lions on the high veld in South Africa where they have traditionally struggled to win. That’s what the Waratahs should have been thinking in the first place. The problem now is that they have to get a game back to make up for the loss to the Sunwolves. New Zealand Super Rugby teams have always been prepared to rotate players, not just for the All Blacks’ benefit, but for their own sake. Of course, the Kiwis have the luxury of depth; they can afford to rest an All Black, develop an emerging player and create more depth. It’s a virtuous circle. While the rotation concept is not totally foreign in Australia, the resting of players has never been widely practiced. There has certainly never been an official across-the-board blueprint as exists now. The Australian policy is a little looser than the Kiwis’, in that teams decide which games their players miss rather than the national body, but it is designed to achieve the same end. Super Rugby teams reluctantly agreed to rest their Wallabies this year as part of a compromise to prevent Rugby Australia adopting another New Zealand policy, which is to centrally contract Super coaches and players. Australia lacks the depth that New Zealand enjoys, but how will Australian teams create depth if they do not expose emerging players? Foley’s replacement in Newcastle, Mack Mason, is regarded as the Wallabies No 10’s heir apparent at the Waratahs. But Mason had only played a total of 29 minutes in his three previous appearances for the Waratahs and it showed. He took the ball to the line well against the Sunwolves, but his kicking and passing were poor under pressure. If Mason was the player identified to succeed Foley, he should have been groomed for the role rather than thrown to the Sunwolves. The lesson for the Australian teams is there is a time and a place for everything, including rotating players. The New Zealand rotation system has always worked best when it has been mutually beneficial for the All Blacks and Super Rugby teams. If it tilts too far in favour of the All Blacks, as it did in 2007, the results can be disastrous. But if Australia’s Super Rugby teams can benefit from the rotation of players as much as the Wallabies do, the problems with the policy will be solved.",Sport
"Calais child refugees waiting 10 times longer to join family in UK Children stuck in Calais as they wait on the Home Office to transfer them to the UK to join their families have seen delays in receiving an initial decision from the department increase 10-fold in two years, the Guardian can reveal. The average wait for a positive response to a request by unaccompanied children in Calais to join families in the UK increased from 10.98 days in 2016 to 111.31 days, nearly four months, according to a Home Office document seen by the Guardian. The average wait for a negative response has nearly quadrupled from 16.5 days to 63.44 days. Children who received a positive response saw the average wait time to be transferred to the UK increase from 26.11 days in 2016 to 198.44 days in 2018, the figures show. The numbers relate to unaccompanied asylum-seeking minors who have made applications under family reunification provisions enshrined in EU law, known as the Dublin III regulation, which must receive an initial response within two months. The rapid decline in standards by the Home Office comes against a backdrop of humanitarians warning the department that the mental and physical health of children is deteriorating due to long delays. Children living in hostels and foster homes went on hunger strike – and in at least one case a child attempted suicide – as they waited much longer than the two-month requirement for a decision to be made on their claim, the Guardian revealed on Sunday. Marie-Charlotte Fabié, director of Safe Passage in France, said: “The minors we help to access family reunification from France to the UK are facing increasing delays on decisions by the British government. “Between 2016 and 2018 the wait for a positive family reunification decision increased to an agonising 111 days. This is all the more surprising given that the UK and French agreed under the Sandhurst Treaty that the UK should respond ‘as quickly as possible and in any case in line with the timeframe’ of two months. “Behind these truly shocking statistics are vulnerable children and families, forced into months of separation and uncertainty about the future. Children have a right to be safe with their loved ones, and the UK and French authorities should be prioritising the transfer of children under Dublin III as a matter of urgency. “We know first-hand how much children and families suffer because of these delays. And we know that family reunion can have a transformative impact on a child’s physical and mental wellbeing. No child should be forced to wait alone when they could be in the UK with family.” Under the Dublin III regulation, France makes a “take charge request” to the UK to signify the child wants to be reunited with a family member in the UK. UK authorities have two months to respond. If the request is accepted, they then have six months to effect the transfer. The document reveals that the number of children who arrived in the UK within eight months from making an initial request decreased from 96% in 2016 to 65% in 2018. Official figures show that 804 requests were made by unaccompanied asylum-seeking children between January 2016 and December 2018 and there were 426 arrivals in the same period, although some of those arrivals could have lodged requests prior to 2016. The Home Office was forced to disclose the figures in a case at the upper tribunal immigration and asylum chamber, in which the department is being challenged over delays faced by three young refugees who were forced to wait months to be reunited with their families. The three teenagers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are an Afghan boy, 16, who had to wait more than four months to be reunited with his older brother; an Eritrean girl, 17, who waited more than five months to join her brother; and another Eritrean girl, 16, who had to wait more than six months to join her older brother. A judgment will be handed down at a later date. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK takes its responsibilities towards unaccompanied children extremely seriously. “There are agreed processes which ensure that the best interests of unaccompanied children are properly considered and at the heart of every decision. It is only right that sufficient time is dedicated to these important steps.”",World news
"Attempts to uncover Great Barrier Reef lobbying thwarted, researcher says A legal expert has criticised Australia’s freedom of information regime after spending two years and more than $1,000 trying to shed light on Australia’s enormous lobbying effort to prevent the Great Barrier Reef from being listed as “in danger”. In 2014-15, Australian government officials spent more than $100,000 visiting and lobbying members of Unesco’s world heritage committee to keep the Great Barrier Reef off the “in danger” list. A group of Australian and US environmental lawyers had found the dangers to the reef overwhelmingly met the criteria for such a listing, but Australia’s lobbying was ultimately successful. The legal academic Prof Reece Walters, of Deakin University, wanted to understand how far Australia had gone in its taxpayer-funded campaign. Walters lodged a freedom of information request in August 2016 for relevant correspondence between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Great Barrier Reef taskforce and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA). He was given documents that were so heavily redacted “so as to render the information useless for any meaningful interpretation”. “The request included minutes of meetings – on all occasions the entire minutes are deleted, leaving nothing but the agenda and day of meeting,” he said. Walters asked the information commissioner to review the case. The GBRMPA argued the information was highly sensitive and would undermine its relations with foreign governments and organisations if released. It argued the documents, if made public, would also potentially undermine upcoming negotiations with the committee over the status of the Great Barrier Reef in 2019-20. Eventually, the information commissioner ordered the authority to disclose more – but far from all – of the material to Walters. But Walters told Guardian Australia the information is not what he originally wanted. Even if it were, the two and a half years of delays had rendered it almost useless. “Who’s now interested in the ways in which the GBR was assessed by an international panel and how those particular members were in any way colluded or corrupted by government? “It’s an old story, who cares? And that’s part of the subversion [of the FOI system], because if I had written this up when it was before the Senate, it might have got some traction.” The freedom of information regime has long been criticised for its lengthy delays and high rates of refusals. Guardian Australia revealed earlier this year that FOI refusals were at their highest levels since records began in 2010-11 and that more than 2,000 requests had taken three months longer than the statutory timeframe for release. Walters has extensive experience with freedom of information in the United Kingdom, which he said is far more open and conducive to transparency than Australia. He said his experience made him fear for those with less ability to grapple with legal concepts and the vagaries of FOI. “I’ve been wrestling with them for two-and-a-half years,” Walters said. “What does that mean for people who don’t have the legal skills, or knowledge of the system, or the ability to lodge appeals?” In 2015, the then DFAT secretary Peter Varghese told Senate estimates that Australia had mounted a “whole-of-government” campaign to prevent the “in danger” listing for the reef. “We are running a major campaign to prevent a listing of the Great Barrier Reef as being in danger,” he said at the time. “There have been a number of assertions made about the management of the Great Barrier Reef and about its vulnerability that are not grounded in fact and which need to be rebutted.”",Australia news

The Irish airline, which transports 130 million people a year, declared 9.9 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, up 6.9% on last year and 49% over the last five years, according to data in the EU’s latest emissions trading system registry. Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, said: “When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal. This trend will only continue until Europe realises that this undertaxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-emission jet fuel.” Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, dismissed climate change concerns as “complete and utter rubbish” in an interview two years ago. His airline is now ranked as Europe’s 10th worst emitter, after nine coal plants. Poland’s Bełchatów is the worst polluter, producing 38 megatonnes of planet-warming emissions annually. Coal emissions are falling, though, as Europe’s transition to cleaner energy continues. In stark contrast, emissions from airlines, which are exempted from fuel taxes and VAT on tickets, have soared by 26.3% since 2014, outpacing all other transport sectors. EasyJet was Europe’s next worst-performing airline, in 31st place on the list, after an 11% rise in emissions in 2018. It was followed by Lufthansa, Norwegian and British Airways, according to analysis of the EU data by the thinktank Sandbag and Transport and Environment. Aviation is responsible for about 3% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, but industry forecasts suggest this could rise by up to 700% by 2050 as the sector grows. Murphy described aviation as “Europe’s biggest climate failure”. Europe’s airlines pay about €800m (£680m) a year for their rights to pollute. But some studies suggest this sum is eclipsed by the €27bn they would have to stump up if their fuel tax and VAT exemptions were ended. Despite increased attention from policymakers, the sector receives up to 85% of its EU emissions trading allowances free, with Ryanair consequently saving €96.6m in 2018. Kevin Anderson, a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said: “Ryanair use new and efficient aircraft rammed to the rafters with passengers, illustrating how technology alone cannot reconcile aviation’s rocketing emissions with the Paris climate commitments. “If we genuinely care for our children’s futures, we need to drive down the demand for aviation. This will require stringent regulations focusing on frequent fliers rather than those taking the occasional trip.” A Ryanair spokesperson said: “Ryanair is Europe’s greenest and cleanest airline. Passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per km travelled than any other airline.”",Business
"Harry Potter among books burned by priests in Poland Catholic priests in Poland have burned books that they say promote sorcery, including one of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter novels, in a ceremony they photographed and posted on Facebook. Three priests in the northern city of Koszalin were pictured carrying the books in a large basket from inside a church to a stone area outside. The books were set alight as prayers were said and a small group of people watched on. A mask, various trinkets and a Hello Kitty umbrella were also visible in the pictures of the makeshift bonfire. The Catholic evangelical foundation SMS From Heaven posted the photographs to its Facebook page, which has 22,000 followers, accompanied by fiery emojis and Old Testament quotes decrying sorcery and idolatry. The stunt provoked mockery from Facebook users, many of whom left comments questioning the sanity of those involved, or making comparisons with Nazi Germany. It is not the first occasion in which the hugely popular Harry Potter series has attracted the ire of religious zealots, some of whom believe the books are inspired by evil spirits and could lead children astray. Kids Against The Sorcerers, a 2016 cartoon film promoted by a number of Russian government agencies, featured a nefarious western plot backed by Nato and Harry Potter to subvert and corrupt Russian schoolchildren. The Catholic church is a powerful force for conservatism in Polish society, and has been at the forefront of a debate in Polish society about LGBT rights and abortion regulations, forming part of a broader culture war involving the country’s rightwing populist government and the more liberal opposition. The church is also struggling with the fallout of allegations of paedophilia against hundreds of priests, which has affected its standing in society.",World news
"French campaigners go to EU over hunting and trapping of birds Bird protection campaigners are to lodge an official complaint with the European Union accusing France of breaking rules on hunting and trapping and failing to protect endangered species. The Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux (LPO) is using the 40th anniversairy of the EU’s “bird directive”, which outlaws the “massive or non-selective” killing of birds to highlight what it deems cruel and illegal methods. These includes gluesticks covered in adhesive lime and set in trees or bushes to catch birds when they land, traps that crush the birds with heavy stones, and nooses. The LPO says it was forced to act after the French government refused to respond to its complaints and the state council approved gluesticks, saying the method was traditional and there was no other satisfactory method of trapping the birds. Stone crush traps, once banned for a century, were legalised in France in 2005 and are also considered unnecessarily cruel as often the birds do not die instantly. Wood pigeons, skylarks, grey geese and curlew are all fair game for French bird hunters, despite a decline in certain species. Legal hunting periods and species quotas are set for different departments, but the LPO says these are often ignored. Kim Dallet, the LPO spokeswoman, said the Ligue had lodged numerous complaints to the French government over methods of hunting birds and the targeting of threatened species but often without response. “To mark the anniversary of the EU directive, we’re taking it up to European level, which will hopefully force the French government to respond and to respect the directive,” she said. She added: “We have species of bird in a bad way in terms of conservation that are still being hunted in France, which is absolutely against the directive. French hunters can kill around 63 different species while in other countries in Europe it’s 20-30 at the most. Also hunters in France do not respect the agreed hunting period or local prefects give them extra hours or days to hunt. “I don’t know what it is about hunting in France, perhaps because we have more of a hunting tradition. But the situation has to evolve.” Two reports by French researchers last year found the number of birds in rural areas had dropped by a third in 15 years, partly because of intensive farming and the “massive use of pesticides”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, joined a hunt during his 40th birthday celebrations at the Château de Chambord in December 2017. “Hunting is a wonderful advantage for biodiversity, development of our rural territory and a popular activity to safeguard,” he told the hunting lobby. Chasseurs de France tweeted a picture of Macron with hunters, saying he had “praised the contribution of hunting to nature”, which brought a swift response from the Elysée that the photo should not be published as Macron had specifically banned pictures being taken.",Environment
"Why am I seeing this?: New Facebook tool to demystify news feed Facebook is attempting to demystify how its news feed works with a new feature that explains to users how it picks the posts and adverts to show them. The company hopes the tool could put an end to the widespread conspiracy theory that it targets users by spying on them with their phone’s microphones, by explaining in plain English the most important factors that determine whether and when they see content on the social network. But the vast majority of the “tens of thousands” of signals the company analyses to decide what content to show users will remain hidden, Facebook said, to avoid overwhelming people with potentially irrelevant information. The new feature, which will roll out for users worldwide over the next month, lets people find out why the site is showing them particular posts by clicking on “Why am I seeing this?” in the contextual menu for each item. The resulting information screen will show generally obvious information about the source of the post, like the fact that the two accounts are friends, or that the user follows the page that posted the content. But it will also show more detailed information about what caused a given post to be placed high up on a user’s news feed. Examples shared by Facebook include “you’ve liked [this friend’s] posts more than posts from others”, “you’ve commented on posts with photos more than other media types” or “this post in [this group] is popular compared to other posts you’ve seen”. Facebook hopes the explanation will allow users to more easily understand why they may be shown posts they don’t want to see, and to take action to hide or mute them if they wish. A similar set of explanations will also be offered for adverts on Facebook, as well as more information than was previously shared about the advertiser’s “custom audiences”, a little-known Facebook feature that lets businesses upload customer lists (including names, email addresses or phone numbers) to the site in order to advertise to people they’ve contacted elsewhere. John Hegeman, the head of Facebook’s news feed, acknowledged the changes were a small step rather than a finished offering. “We don’t think this is going to solve everything,” he said, “but we want to know how we can build on it.” Hegeman said that the persistent conspiracy theory that Facebook eavesdrops on users using their phone’s microphone, to target them with better ads, “is a good example of why this sort of tool and work is so important”. He said: “We don’t listen to people on their microphones. But people do do a lot of different things on Facebook: they indicate what things they’re interested in, etc etc. That I think means you often have a very good understanding of their interests. Because people don’t always understand how that works, they often reach these other types of conclusion, like ‘oh, Facebook must be doing this other thing to figure out what to show to me’. “So our hope is that when you see something, and want to know why Facebook showed it to you, then you’re able to use these types of tools to find out.”",Technology
"‘Where are all the black women in grime? The same place they are in the rest of the music industry – sidelined' A year ago, I wrote an article for this paper asking where all the black women were in grime. Not just as artists and MCs but as managers, journalists, photographers and producers. The genre is now a mainstay of the mainstream and celebrated for championing the voices of diverse Britain, but notable black women remain largely absent. Curious, considering its history is rooted in the lives of Britain’s black working class. I recently asked the same question in a documentary with BBC Radio 4 and though there were several answers, the one that felt most pertinent is that this is hardly a “grime problem”. The music industry as a whole has a dearth of black women. Whether it is pop music or more so-called “urban” sounds such as UK rap and Afro-bashment, black female artists are very rarely heard above the underground. Even in styles such as afrobeats (where gender is the issue as opposed to race) you’ll likely name heavyweights such as Wizkid, Davido, Burna Boy before one female artist. In more soulful British pop and R&amp;B, the likes of Jess Glynne, Adele and Jessie J are the major faces. Whatever the genre, it is hard to think of a black woman who has had the same commercial success as them – at least, without jumping ship to the US as Sade did. Looking into the role Sade’s skin tone would have played in her success stateside complicates an already fraught conversation further. Colourism – the preferential treatment of lighter-skinned black people – is prevalent in the entertainment industry. If female singers and industry gatekeepers aren’t white, most are light. Some of the biggest artists in the US are black women – Beyoncé, Cardi B, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj – and their complexion is no coincidence. It is similar in the UK; lighter-skinned artists such as Jorja Smith, Stefflon Don and Mabel are higher profile than darker, equally talented musicians such as Ms Banks, Little Simz, NAO and Ray Blk. In my documentary, the veteran MC Stush talks about being pitted against the fairer-skinned musician Ms Dynamite during their prime. Meanwhile, dark-skinned men continue to do commercially well regardless – Stormzy, Not3s, NSG, Dave. The penance of needing to be thought pretty falls only to women. There are endless panels, articles and workshops interrogating the lack of women in grime, but things become awkward when prefixed with “black”. One white female insider wrote to me saying: “I only want to take part in an article celebrating all women pushing grime forward – such as myself.” The belief is that discussing black women specifically is inherently divisive, but as the academic Joy White, of the Independent Social Research Foundation, says, complicity is another reason for discomfort: “You have to say, especially if you’re a music-industry insider, what your role was in either gatekeeping or turning the spotlight away or not noticing,” she says. “You have to look at yourself.” Where are all the black women in grime is available to listen on BBC Radio 4 catch-up now.",Life and style
"Liam Gallagher’s Pretty Green calls in administrators Liam Gallagher’s loss-making fashion brand Pretty Green has said it remains hopeful of finding a buyer to save the business, despite falling into administration in a move that puts more than 170 jobs at risk. The company, founded by the former Oasis frontman in 2009, has been on the brink of insolvency for the last two weeks. Last month Pretty Green appointed Moorfields Advisory to review strategic options for the future of the business. Moorfields, which oversaw Toys R Us UK’s insolvency last year, has been appointed as administrators and is on a last-ditch hunt to find a buyer to save all or part of the business. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said the brand had a attracted a “large amount of interest”. “We continue to work closely with Pretty Green’s management and its advisers,” he said. “Following a period of marketing the brand attracted a large amount of interest, so we remain hopeful a deal can be done. The brand has a strong following and it is unfortunate that similar to many other retailers who rely on concessions they have suffered as a consequence of larger department store insolvencies.” Pretty Green, which has 12 standalone stores, 40 concessions and a wholesale business, will continue trading until further notice. There have been reports that the brand, of which Gallagher is believed to be the biggest shareholder, had been in conversations with a number of interested parties. “Pretty Green is not immune to the challenges facing the UK high street as customers migrate from purchasing in store to online,” a spokesman for Moorfields said. The company took a hit when House of Fraser entered administration in August, owing the brand just over £500,000. The department store was a significant stockist, housing 20 concessions. House of Fraser was immediately bought out of administration by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct group. The brand increased sales by 32% to £38.2m last year and it significantly reduced pre-tax losses to £1.5m, after recording a £5.6m loss in 2017. The accounts show Pretty Green incurred costs of more than £333,000 relating to an abandoned stock market flotation. In 2017 it received an £11m cash injection from the private equity firm Rockpool Investments to help expand the business.",Business
"Brexit indicative votes include customs union and Norway-style deal MPs will vote on four alternatives to Theresa May’s thrice-rejected Brexit deal, including a customs union and a Norway-style deal, as backbenchers seek to force the government to change course. With 11 days to go until Britain is due to leave the European Union, with or without a deal, the Speaker, John Bercow, selected four of the options tabled by MPs for consideration in “indicative votes”. They are a customs union, suggested by the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke; Nick Boles’s “common market 2.0”; Labour MP Peter Kyle’s call for a “confirmatory” referendum; and SNP Joanna Cherry’s motion, aimed at allowing parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Labour tabled its own Brexit policy, including a customs union and single market alignment, as a separate option at the last minute on Monday, but Bercow declined to allow MPs to vote on it. The indicative votes process kicked off after MPs supported a business motion tabled by the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin, setting out how it would take place, by 322 votes to 277 – a majority of 45. Cabinet ministers will once again be instructed to boycott the votes, as MPs make a second attempt to coalesce around an alternative deal. The prime minister had suggested she would “engage constructively” with the indicative votes process, set up by a cross-party group of MPs led by Letwin. But Downing Street sources confirmed that the government would whip Conservative MPs to oppose the business motion kicking off Monday’s votes. Backbench MPs and junior ministers will then be allowed a free vote on the various options being considered. Labour said that unlike last Monday’s indicative votes, which resulted in all eight options being rejected, it would whip its MPs to support “common market 2.0”, the plan involving single market membership drawn up by a cross-party group including Boles, and the Labour MPs Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock. The group have been in close consultation with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, about couching their plan in a way the party could support – although it involves accepting the free movement of people, about which some Labour MPs in leave seats have concerns. The deeply divided cabinet, which May’s own chief whip, Julian Smith, described in a BBC interview on Monday as the “worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history”, will be instructed not to vote. Asked about Smith’s comments, May’s spokesman said she continued to have confidence in her chief whip. “I’ll leave it to historians to make their judgments on history,” he said. Smith suggested the government should have been clearer in the aftermath of the 2017 general election it would have to tack towards a softer Brexit deal in order to build a majority in the hung parliament. The prime minister’s spokesman said “soft Brexit” was “not terminology the prime minister has ever used”, but underlined her continued objections to Britain remaining part of a customs union. If MPs do support a closer future trading relationship with the EU, the prime minister will face a fateful choice about whether to accept and implement that decision. Her spokesman declined to say what she would do, but underlined the government’s continued opposition to a customs union. “She has said on a number of occasions that she believes it is important for the UK to have its own trade policy,” he said. Many Brexiters on the Conservative benches, including within the cabinet, are vehemently opposed to accepting a customs union. The European Research Group deputy chair, Steve Baker, told the BBC’s Politics Live on Monday he would not rule out voting against the government on a no-confidence motion, if May embraced the policy. “I think it would really shatter the party. I’ve said that before. I’m not sure what would happen … It would be a clear breach of our manifesto promises,” he said. Pressed on whether he could even support a no-confidence motion in those circumstances, he said: “At this point I can foresee no circumstances while, as a Conservative MP, I voted against the government in a confidence motion. But we are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high, and so transcend party politics and what this country is about, and the fundamental British value that political power rests on consent, that I think these things are coming on to the table.” Downing Street suggested it would be for the cabinet at a marathon meeting on Tuesday to decide how to proceed, if, as expected, MPs supported a softer deal. But government sources also hinted May could still aim to bring her deal to parliament for a fourth time on Wednesday – when Letwin and his colleagues plan to set aside another day of parliamentary business, potentially to pass legislation implementing the outcome of Monday’s votes. The prime minister warned MPs last Friday when her deal was rejected by MPs for the third time: “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house”, but it was not clear how she hoped to proceed.",Politics
"Gillian Ballance obituary My friend Gillian Ballance, who has died aged 89, was a social worker and lecturer who specialised in helping people struggling with the mental pain caused by difficult circumstances in their lives. She began her career in 1956 as a child care officer at Hertfordshire county council, where she was eventually promoted to area children’s officer for the South Hertfordshire area. In 1970 she moved to Hatfield Polytechnic (now the University of Hertfordshire) as a lecturer in social work, simultaneously training as a Jungian psychoanalyst and eventually joining the Society of Analytical Psychology. In her early days at Hatfield Poly Gillian convinced it to set up a full diploma in counselling. Other higher education institutions followed her lead and she later developed a postgraduate diploma in counselling at Hatfield, too. She stayed there until retirement in 1994, immediately after which she spent several months in Mostar, following the war in the former Yugoslavia, as a volunteer with the Unicef psychosocial programme, helping traumatised children. She then began working for Medical Foundation for the Care of the Victims of Torture (now Freedom from Torture), largely giving her services voluntarily, although she treated her work as a professional commitment. In her 80s she also volunteered for the Helen Bamber Foundation, which provides help to refugees and victims of human trafficking. Gillian was born in Hatfield to May (nee Trower) and her husband, Alaric Ballance, who was a GP. Her father died when she was three, and in 1941 her elder brother, Denis, was killed in the second world war while serving with the RAF. After Downe House school, near Newbury, Berkshire, she studied social work at the London School of Economics and then Liverpool University, before embarking on the first part of her long career. In her last years many of the refugees and asylum seekers Gillian had helped visited her, as did former clients from her social work days. She delighted in seeing them all again and ate the food they brought with gusto, given that she was a hopeless cook. The painting she had started in her heyday sustained her throughout her 80s. She died shortly before her 2017 oil painting The Lonely Wait was shortlisted for the Lynn Painter-Stainers prize. It was later exhibited at the Mall Galleries in London. She is survived by a nephew and two nieces.",Society
"It’s true: The Archers is far more sexist than James Bond Using the analytic tool beloved by patriarchy-smashers everywhere, the Bechdel-Wallace test, the researchers Cara Courage and Nicola Headlam have found that The Archers is more sexist than the James Bond film From Russia with Love. To recap, the test requires two women to engage in dialogue about something other than a man for longer than 30 seconds. Only one-third of Archers episodes met this test even once. The BBC responded with a staunch but hard to comprehend defence: “Unlike the Hollywood films this test was designed for, over 18,000-plus episodes The Archers has charted the whole lives of the men and women of Ambridge, both professional and personal.” So, erm, it can’t be sexist because there are women in it, and they’ve been talking for a really, really, really long time. Germaine Greer, always ready with a wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing remark (like … it sounds sexist … but she’s a feminist … so it can’t be sexist … except it sounds sexist), cut in: “It’s probably true to say that when most women talk to other women they talk about men and their feelings.” I suppose. If by “men” she means the chef Joël Robuchon, the musician Herb Alpert and the band Franz Ferdinand, then sure, she has described every conversation I’ve had today. But if, by contrast, she means we just yak on about our misters and how we feel about their habits, then she really needs to have a word with herself before she becomes “ex-feminist”. Look, Archers, you’re bang to rights. Women who have nothing but their menfolk to discuss are not sophisticated and, more to the point, not accurate representations of the real thing. But your problems really would snowball if anyone were to update the Bechdel-Wallace test so that it reached beyond Hollywood to cover your average agricultural drama of very long standing. Then it might exclude: women who are always making tea; women who are always talking about cake; women who become fiercely competitive with one another over trivial activities such as amateur dramatics to hilarious effect; women who have sexual awakenings that, far from being celebrated by those who love them, are considered inherently ridiculous; women who disapprove of their daughters-in-law; women who get annoyed by their mothers-in-law; women who cluck and fuss; and women who go on about their cats. If the Archers were to expunge all sexist tropes, then apart from the odd millennial, who has to go away to university just to avoid the deadly choice (busybody or good listener?) that all fictional women of the very old school must face, they would end up with no women at all.",Television & radio
"Carol Bell obituary My friend Carol Bell, who has died aged 68 of acute aortic thrombosis, was, despite being a woman of few words, a community builder with a huge capacity for friendship. She would shake hands with everyone she met – visitors, strangers in the street, people at church – asking after their family and their pets. Born in London, Carol was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth (nee Corder), a cleaner, and David Bell, a bus conductor. From birth she had severe learning disabilities and while her mother loved her and wanted to keep her at home, her father found the situation difficult. In the 1950s there was little support, and with a growing family, they struggled to cope. At the age of two Carol went to live in a hospital for “severely subnormal children”, later moving to St Ebba’s hospital in Epsom, Surrey, which at one point had more than 600 beds for “mentally subnormal patients”. She lived there until she was 39. Her mother visited for more than a decade, but in the end the visits became just too painful, and family contact stopped. In 1989, such large institutions had begun to be closed. Carol went to live at Gothic Lodge in West Norwood, south London, part of the international federation of L’Arche Communities, which believes in encouraging shared lives between people with and without learning disabilities. She lived in the house with five other people with disabilities and eight care assistants, including myself and my friend Chris Sadler. Very little is known about Carol’s institutional years, as records were lost, but we had glimpses: the way she folded her clothes impeccably every evening; how she flinched if lightly touched on her back; the way she would say “Ignore him! No party for you!” if she thought someone had misbehaved. Initially Carol glued herself to Chris obsessively, clearly worried she would be left on her own. But slowly she relaxed and her other qualities emerged. She was curious about people, observing them deeply. She would mimic their quirks, but also show compassion to anyone in distress. She was happy to help, offer a drink, bring a blanket, or sit quietly with someone who was sad or lonely. She loved babies, dogs and loud music. She was always ready for an adventure – she found holidays immensely exciting. In her older years, being unsteady on her feet was frightening. Would she be upset or feel diminished at using a wheelchair? Just the opposite: she was empowered. She could wave, nod, give directions, visit her many friends again, be queen of ice-cream. Perhaps most important of all, contact with her mother was re-established after a gap of two decades. Years later, at her mother’s funeral in 2006, she met all her siblings – some for the first time. Carol got the deepest pleasure from visiting them and meeting her six nieces and four nephews. It seemed that finally she understood her place in the world and was at peace with it. Carol is survived by five of her siblings, James, June, John, Robert and Linda. Her eldest brother, David, died last year.",Society
"Facebook considering hiring editors to pick quality news for users Facebook could start employing editors to select “high-quality news” to show to users, in the social network’s latest attempt to lose its reputation as a source for disinformation. Mark Zuckerberg said he is considering the introduction of a dedicated news section on the social network, which could use either humans or algorithms to chose stories from outlets that are “broadly trusted” by society. “We’re not going to have journalists making news,” said the social network boss, who explained the aim of the new feature would be to promote material produced by third parties. “What we want to do is make sure that this is a product that can get people high-quality news.” Zuckerberg also said he is considering whether Facebook should start paying news publishers to include their articles in this news section in order to reward “high-quality, trustworthy content”. Facebook sources suggest the news product has been in development for some time and should be ready to launch by the end of this year. A system in which human editors are involved in choosing which news stories should be shown to users would be a break with Facebook’s traditional approach of using algorithms to highlight material. The news feature would be a separate section of Facebook which would run in parallel with the long-established news feed, the first screen users see after login which mixes friends’ holiday photos with posts from news outlets and other pages that Facebook users have chosen to follow. Zuckerberg estimated that between 10-20% of the Facebook audience would be interested in the proposed section, with the majority of the site’s users avoiding it because they want “to see what’s going on with their friends” rather than read journalism. The proposed product would have similarities with Facebook’s existing Watch product for video or Apple News, which already employs human editors to choose stories which are then pushed to tens of millions of Apple users. The move would be likely to benefit long-established traditional publishers, which tend to top trust rankings and have been long-time critics of the existing Facebook model. Facebook has largely avoided paying publishers for news material, instead suggesting they should appreciate the extra readers being sent to sites by referrals from the social network. Facebook’s previous record of of using human editors to oversee news has been patchy. It sacked all the staff working on its trending news feature after they were accused of pro-liberal bias in the US by Republican politicians, leaving the social network with a reputational headache during the 2016 US Presidential election which predated widespread concerns about fake news and disinformation Zuckerberg made the comments in a lengthy discussion with Mathias Döpfner, the chief executive of German publishing house Axel Springer, who has been a regular critic of the social network and the lack of revenue it sends to news publishers.",Technology
"BBC to take control of UKTV in £180m deal with Discovery The BBC is turning to reruns of Top Gear and Only Fools and Horses to help plug a looming £745m funding gap after sealing its most expensive ever deal to take over the owner of the Dave and Gold channels. BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm, has taken control of the lion’s share of UKTV, which runs 10 free-to-air and pay-TV channels, in a transaction worth about £180m. The BBC will take control of seven of the 10 UKTV channels including Eden, Alibi and the popular Dave and Gold. The latter shows BBC classics including Fawlty Towers, Blackadder and the Victoria Wood hit Dinnerladies, while Dave has become a bastion of male-targeted broadcasting with its mix of panel shows, comedy and Top Gear. The US pay-TV giant Discovery, which co-owns UKTV with the BBC, will get the Good Food, Home and Really channels as part of the deal. The BBC has used a combination of cash, debt and a content deal to take control of UKTV because it does not have the financial firepower for a straight buyout of Discovery. UKTV is a cash cow for the BBC, with profits surging from £29m to more than £90m in the past eight years, valuing the business at about £750m. UKTV also pays £54m a year to BBC Studios for the rights to an extensive library of BBC shows from Top Gear to Dad’s Army. The deal is the biggest in the corporation’s history – well in excess of the ill-fated £130m purchase of travel guide publisher Lonely Planet – and comes at a politically sensitive time for the broadcaster. The BBC has warned of channel closures and cuts to services if it were forced to take on the full £745m cost of paying the licence fee for over-75s when the government stops funding it. The BBC has been approached in the past about selling its stake in UKTV, worth almost £400m in straight cash terms, but instead has decided to spend heavily to take control of the hugely profitable business. “BBC Studios taking control of the UKTV channels that best fit our programmes is good news,” said Tony Hall, the BBC director general. “It means a secure future with long-term commercial returns.” The BBC has agreed to pay about £100m in cash, take on about £70m of debt from UKTV that Discovery was obliged to pay, and also give Discovery a £10m share of the dividend that UKTV has amassed in its current financial year. In addition, the BBC has agreed a lucrative 10-year, £300m deal to license its natural history and wildlife content, spanning hits such as Blue Planet and newer fare including Dynasties, for a new international streaming service Discovery is planning to launch in 2020. David Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, has said the new streaming service “will look like a natural history Netflix” and “the fact that content will be coming off Netflix is important to us”. The BBC has been an outspoken critic of the rising power of Netflix, which in November further muscled in on the corporation’s territory by signing Sir David Attenborough to front a documentary from the makers of Planet Earth and Blue Planet. Hall defended selling off crown jewel rights to Discovery, which will now have highly sought-after content on its own international streaming service. “This [deal] is not based out of a threat, it is based out of a strength,” said Hall. “The natural history unit is world-beating … who do you want to ally yourself with? The strongest people to ally ourselves with is [Discovery]. Discovery and ourselves are motivated by the same sorts of ideas and ideals.” Under the terms of the content deal the new streaming service, which will feature Discovery and BBC content, will not be available in the UK, Ireland and China. Hall said it is the biggest content sales deal the corporation has ever struck. Last year, Discovery struck a $2bn (£1.5bn) 12-year deal with the PGA Tour to create a “Netflix of golf” streaming service supported by an exclusive programming deal with Tiger Woods. Hall said that taking full control meant the BBC would be able to sort out the complicated video-on-demand rights relating to UKTV shows, while helping pave the way to launch BritBox UK, the streaming service joint venture with ITV. The BBC said it will keep the UKTV brand and its separate offices in Hammersmith, London, and maintain its strategy including its highly successful move into investing in original content. UKTV employs about 290 staff. Nearly all UKTV staff will remain employed by the BBC with only a small number moving to Discovery.",Media
"Doctors at breaking point in underfunded NHS Those of us with friends and relatives working as doctors in the NHS will have experienced no surprise on reading your article about the treatment of junior doctors (Doctor reveals ‘petty tortures’ that force colleagues to restrict their private lives, 29 March). We witness first-hand the toll that working in the NHS takes on their lives. Along with the shocking situations described in the article, we know from personal accounts that the following are commonplace: 12-hour shifts with no break; demand for the doctor’s attendance at two life-or-death crises at the same moment; having to stay with a patient for two extra hours at the end of a 12-hour shift because there is no one to hand the patient over to. Plus, of course, they work nights and weekends on a regular basis. All this in a profession where if you make a mistake it could mean a patient dies. We all know we have a badly underfunded health service. Who is paying the price for the underfunding? Our doctors, along with all the other overworked and demoralised health professionals. The cost of the underfunding falls on their physical and mental health, and it is no wonder they are leaving the service in droves. If no action is taken, the service will go into a downward spiral of staff shortages, leading to more demoralisation, even more staff leaving, and the NHS, on which most of us rely, will be wrecked. Jill Jones Leeds • I was, until a few years ago, a BMA official who represented young doctors in circumstances such as those described in your article. Even when problems were raised at higher levels of management, the same lack of care was consistently shown, implying an institutionalised indifference to the wellbeing of medical staff. The worst example I encountered concerned a junior doctor seeking to return from sick leave after she had attempted suicide. Hard though it may be to believe, before she was permitted to return, she was required to address, in a disciplinary context, the “theft” of the insulin that she took in a very serious attempt to end her life. The most senior manager in the unit concerned supported this approach, emboldened by the vulnerability of the young doctor who was not fit to go through the strain of the potential actions I discussed with her, and for obvious reasons did not wish public exposure. It was only one compassionate HR manager, whom I involved as someone I could trust and who was as appalled as I was when he found out what was happening, who intervened and made himself unpopular with other managers by doing so. The doctor, as a compromise, was still required to endure a humiliating and distressing formal meeting in which her “offence” was discussed, noted and permitted to be subject to no further action. Stephen Smith Glasgow • How depressing to read of the findings of Dr Joanna Poole concerning the experiences of her fellow “junior” doctors. The most outrageous aspect is that hospital administrators are congratulating themselves on providing lounges and bedrooms for junior doctors. When I was a very junior doctor in the 1960s, any hospital that did not provide a lounge with a TV as a minimum would not have had any junior doctors and, since many posts were resident, bedrooms were also necessary. We felt that, despite limited resources, the management were on our side. That is unfortunately no longer true, as evidenced by your report. The continuing sale or conversion to offices of decent residential facilities, which started under the Thatcher dictatorship, has left many hospitals with recruitment problems, particularly in London as lower-paid staff cannot afford rents. During the 1960s and 70s there was a realisation that junior doctors’ hours were not acceptable and some progress was made to deal with the problem: we are now seeing a return to the bad old days. John Hurdley (Consultant anaesthetist, retired thank God), Birmingham • We owe our gratitude and thanks to Dr Joanna Poole for compiling and submitting her dossier of over 400 accounts of “petty tortures” that our colleagues have endured in their work environments. Although these accounts are shocking, they are sadly not surprising. We stand in support of all colleagues today who wish to speak out about any mistreatment they have suffered in order to provide patient care. We share concerns that these issues occur in hospital-based settings, and also in primary care. There are colleagues from all levels of seniority: trainees, salaried doctors and partners who anonymously voice concerns about culture and working conditions. Such accounts are not surprising. As a system, we are at breaking point and the numbers speak for themselves. We are saddened by the volume of evidence that has been collected to date about the culture of bullying, inhumane treatment and disrespect for humanity that permeates throughout the NHS in both primary and secondary care. More is being done to promote and drive wellbeing initiatives, but without serious culture change we risk potentiating the recruitment and retention crisis. We will support any colleagues who wish to come forward, either to share with us their story or who are in need of support. We are your college and we will endeavour to work for you. Dr A Sen Mukherjee Wellbeing lead, First5 committee, Royal College of GPs • Your report on the treatment of trainee doctors describes treatment of employees that amounts to a serious breach of the employer’s duty under section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA). In other workplaces, less serious breaches than those described lead to enforcement action by the HSE, including prosecutions of serious or repeat offenders, because breach of these duties is a criminal offence. If the NHS regulators lack the power to enforce HSWA, they should call on the HSE or the police to act on their behalf, before someone dies through their inaction.

"Government can’t regulate Facebook – it’s up to all of us I didn’t see this coming but … I agree with Mark Zuckerberg. The Facebook chief executive has called for more government regulation of the internet. And what he has said is pretty sensible, if a little light on detail. The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. I know what you’re thinking: isn’t Zuck just passing the buck? Hasn’t his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he’s saying it’s up to governments to fix? You’re not wrong. The four areas he’s concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals. But that doesn’t mean his announcement isn’t good news. Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation. It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and, indeed, nation states, as some quaint 20th-century tech that will disappear in a few years, like CDs or fax machines. Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being “disruptors”, arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all. And until now they haven’t been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones. The change of heart should be welcomed. But the devil, as ever, is in the detail. One of the big challenges facing governments around the world is not whether to regulate social media companies such as Facebook, but how to. If you’re like me and the internet has given you the attention span of a four-year-old child, you’re already bored. But ultimately no regulation of tech giants will work unless users are involved. And that’s why we have to engage in this debate. I shouldn’t need to remind you how high the stakes are. On 15 March the Christchurch shootings were livestreamed on Facebook. Terrorists can now use the internet as a recruiting ground and propaganda arm. Young people like Molly Russell (who killed herself in November 2017) are shown content about self-harm on sites like Pinterest and Instagram while they sit in their bedrooms at night. As many as 87 million people’s data may have been shared illegally with Cambridge Analytica. Removing ourselves from these platforms is no longer a realistic option. Companies like Facebook aren’t just a bit of fun, they are an integral part of life for millions of people. The internet at its best connects and empowers: it is worth fighting for. But the way companies operate has not been under enough scrutiny until recently. Facebook has committed to creating an independent body to review its moderation decisions, nicknamed the Facebook supreme court. If it is to function properly, the court of public opinion will be equally important in holding social media giants to account. If we are concerned about online harassment we can, and should, report incidents to Facebook. But we also need to raise our voices by, for example, signing Level Up’s petition calling on Facebook to rethink how it keeps women safe online. The bad news is there is no magic wand that will keep the best parts of the internet and get rid of the worst. We can’t leave it to politicians to regulate companies like Facebook. Zuckerberg’s article talks a lot about prohibition of content. It’s encouraging to see sites like Facebook banning white supremacist and white nationalist accounts. But we can’t just police people and ideas we don’t like off the internet. There will always be somewhere else online for them to go. So while it’s right for mainstream sites like Facebook and YouTube to moderate content, removing people’s platforms to say harmful things is only part of the solution. Think of Facebook as a bit like Ryanair or British Airways. If I get on a plane and the man sat next to me gets drunk and tries to grope me, I can file a police report when we land. But while we’re in the air, my best bet is that the cabin crew and other passengers will deal with the problem. There are things that airlines can do to reduce the likelihood of that man behaving badly on a flight. There are rules that should be in place if he does. But Ryanair is not responsible for drunk and handsy men, just as Facebook and Google aren’t responsible for racism and terrorism. That’s why we should be wary of anyone claiming it’s as simple as deactivating people’s accounts. That might be part of the solution – much like removing people from flights – but the authorities have to take online behaviour seriously, and punish it with the full force of the law. If the laws as they currently stand can’t cope with the shift to virtual spaces, then they’ll need to be rewritten for the digital age. There is a reasonable chance the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are too big to regulate. Which is why politicians like US senator Elizabeth Warren have suggested we break them up into smaller pieces. Warren wants us to curb the power of big tech by splitting up Apple’s platform from its app store and forbidding Amazon from owning food retailer Whole Foods Market and shoe store Zappos. Her proposal would stop future mergers of tech firms and might mean Facebook would be forced to sell the competitors it has bought (such as Instagram and WhatsApp). It’s an eye-catching idea, but it’s narrowly focused on making companies like Facebook and Google less profitable, rather than making them do less harm. The culture of disruption within big tech firms regardless of consequences is as much of a problem as their size. And changing that requires us to use our power as consumers alongside action from regulators. We cannot sit back and wait for government to solve this any more than we can expect Zuckerberg to. Wider society must play its part and apply the pressure needed so that those in power uphold – and change –the law when it comes to big tech and its responsibilities to us all. • Carys Afoko is the executive director and co-founder of Level Up, a community for feminists who want to work together to end sexism",Opinion
"Insects have ‘no place to hide’ from climate change, study warns Insects have “no place to hide” from climate change, scientists have said after analysing 50 years’ worth of UK data. The study found that woodlands, whose shade was expected to protect species from warming temperatures, are just as affected by climate change as open grasslands. The research examined records of the first springtime flights of butterflies, moths and aphids and the first eggs of birds between 1965 and 2012. As average temperatures have risen, aphids are now emerging a month earlier, and birds are laying eggs a week earlier. The scientists said this could mean animals were becoming “out of sync” with their prey, with potentially serious ramifications for ecosystems. Researchers are increasingly concerned about dramatic drops in populations of insects, which underpin much of nature. In February it was said that these falls could lead to a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, and in March there was further evidence of widespread loss of pollinating insects in recent decades in Britain. Other studies, from Germany and Puerto Rico, have shown falling numbers in the last 25 to 35 years. Another showed butterflies in the Netherlands had declined by at least 84% over the last 130 years. James Bell, at Rothamsted Research institute, who led the woodlands research, said: “Under global warming you would expect woodlands to have some protection for insects, a buffer against change. But we didn’t see that. It is the major surprise and is disturbing. There is really no place to hide against the effects of global warming if you are an insect in the UK.” Another surprise was that insects and birds living in farmland are emerging later in the spring, not earlier as expected. “We can only assume this is to do with other, non-climate factors,” Bell said. The loss of wild areas and changing crop types could be among the factors, he said, along with declining food availability leading to delayed breeding. James Pearce-Higgins, of the British Trust for Ornithology, said: “Birds are at the top of many food chains and are sensitive to the impacts of climate change on the availability of their insect prey.” A separate new study found that populations of birds that rely on insects for food fell by 13% across Europe between 1990 and 2015, and by 28% in Denmark, which the scientists used as a national case study. The omnivorous birds assessed did not show a decline. The UK research, published in the journal Global Change Biology, found that the shift to earlier emergence or egg-laying varied considerably according to the type of habitat and how far north the species lives. Aphids breed very rapidly and can adapt to changing temperatures quickly. Their first flight is now an average of 30 days earlier than 50 years ago. Birds, butterflies and moths are appearing one to two weeks earlier. Bell said the changing timings were affecting farming, with aphids arriving earlier but potato crops being planted later due to wetter winters. This combination meant the aphids, which transmit viruses, were attacking much younger plants. “Plants are just like babies, with very poorly developed immune systems, so when a virus is transmitted into a young potato plant it has a much greater effect,” he said. Jon Pickup, of the Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture division of the Scottish government, said: “As pests, it remains a concern that aphid migrations are getting earlier at a dramatic rate and this piece of work shows us that signal across the UK very clearly.” Bell said timing mismatches were also affecting wildlife. “For example, the leafing date of the oak tree determines when the caterpillars will appear, and that determines when blue tits that feed on caterpillars lay their first egg,” he said. “If they become desynchronised, it has cascading effects through the food chain, leading to fewer eggs, and this has been seen.” During February’s exceptionally warm weather there were sightings of rooks nesting, ladybirds mating and dozens of migratory swallows arriving along the south-west coast, all more than a month ahead of schedule.",Environment
"Teaching children to respect and celebrate LGBT+ relationships It is most unhelpful for Sir Michael Wilshaw to link the teaching of LGBT+ equality to the teaching of British “liberal” values (LGBT-rights lessons must be reinstated, says ex-Ofsted head, 26 March). Does he have in mind the fact that the homophobic section 28 was only removed from the British statute books in 2003? Or the fact that LGBT+ asylum seekers have to undergo demeaning interrogations to “prove” that they are genuine, often resulting in people being sent to countries where they face imprisonment, and possibly the death penalty? Or is he referring to the “hostile environment” that saw people who have lived in Britain for decades uprooted from their homes? Or stripping a young woman of her British citizenship and condemning her baby to die in a Syrian refugee camp? It is absolutely right to teach children to respect and celebrate LGBT+ relationships, and indeed this should apply to all schools whether their parents are majority Muslim, Jewish, Christian or of no faith. The oppression of LGBT+ people should not be used as a stick with which to beat another oppressed group. Yes to LGBT+ inclusive education, no to Islamophobia. Geoff Dexter Co-founder, LGBT+ Against Islamophobia • I was pleased to see that last week MPs voted overwhelmingly for guidelines introducing LGBT-inclusive sex and relationship education in our schools. As a gay man who went to school in James Gray’s North Wiltshire constituency, I can testify that this has been woefully absent from our education system in the past. This is about giving children an understanding that different types of relationships exist, and that people can identify and love in different ways. Would we pretend to our children that different religions and ethnicities don’t exist? However, I was appalled to see that James Gray was one of 21 MPs to vote against this. This from a man who admitted having an affair while his wife was fighting cancer. Mr Gray, can I ask what right you have to restrict our children from learning about real love? Oliver Boaler Manchester • BBC journalists have publicly criticised Question Time’s decision to debate the teaching of tolerance of LGBT relationships in primary schools, arguing that the issue should not be up for debate (BBC criticised for debating ‘morality’ of LGBT lessons, 30 March). The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it robs the human race, posterity as well as the existing generation: those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error. By banning a speaker you are not only assuming your own infallibility but denying yourself a vital part of a liberal education – namely, the ability to learn to weigh arguments.

"Dissecting jackfruit and Gypsy tart I do not know how things are in Kerala, but the unripe jackfruit is certainly not left to rot on the tree in either West Bengal in India or in Bangladesh (A fruit worthy of: Monsters, Inc, Zoe Williams, G2, 28 March). It is actually one of the more expensive vegetables, and since the ripe fruit is also much in demand, cutting the green fruit down is a loss to the grower if it is not sold at a good price. Like most other vegetables, Bengali home cooking has several recipes for the young jackfruit, and it is often called “the goat from the tree”. This is because the goat is the most-eaten animal in most of India. While no eater is fooled, the taste and the flavour of the green jackfruit in the hands of a good cook come quite close to those of goat meat. The vegans in Britain are in good company, then. Tirthankar Mukherjee Mosbach, Germany • Zoe Williams misses out an important point: the jackfruit seed is one of the best natural aphrodisiacs in the world.

"Yorkshire aren’t to blame for the rise of Kolpak cricketers Matthew Engel’s article is a powerful and comprehensive analysis of both the context and circumstances leading to Duanne Olivier sacrificing his South Africa career and joining Yorkshire as a “Kolpak” player (Sport, 1 April). But his conclusion that Yorkshire are to blame is wrong. As he points out, there are 43 current Kolpak county players in England. It is the International Cricket Council (ICC) who have stood by and let an unregulated market develop, failing to make any legal challenge to the Kolpak ruling, or introduce new regulations – with tacit support from the ECB? At an international level, it is also the ICC’s inequitable distribution of funding, dominated by Australia, England and India – in terms of rewards and control – that reinforces divisions between richer and poorer nations resulting in senior players “migrating” – sacrificing national identity for individual rewards in white-ball cricket. Also, the ECB could do far more to discourage Kolpak and international players through further restricting numbers and greatly increasing financial incentives to recruit “home grown” players, especially from the local leagues.

"Knife crime prevention plan unfair on teachers, say unions Teachers have reacted angrily to proposals to make them responsible for preventing teenage knife crime and serious violence, accusing the government of using schools as scapegoats. Under the proposals, teachers would be required by law to report children they fear are caught up in a life of violence, and would be held accountable if they fail to do so. School leaders said the proposals were unreasonable and unworkable, and that neither the blame for nor the solution to violent crime lay with schools. They pointed instead to cuts to youth services and policing. It is proposed that teachers, nurses and doctors will have a public health duty to flag up concerns about teenagers they believe may be involved with knife crime or serious violence. Warning signs could include worrying behaviour at school or suspicious injuries at A&amp;E. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is hard to see how it would be either workable or reasonable to make teachers accountable for preventing knife crime. What sort of behaviour would they be expected to report and who would they report to? “Aside from the practical considerations, we have to ask whether it is fair to put the onus on teachers for what is essentially a government failure to put enough police on the streets.” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Neither the blame for nor the solution to violent crime can be laid at the door of schools or frontline hospital staff. It needs real solutions put in place to prevent yet more incidents occurring – solutions that address the causes and not just the symptoms. “The home secretary should accept the impact the decimation of youth services has had, leaving very few safe places for children to go outside of school hours or during the holidays.” Chris Keates, the NASUWT general secretary, said: “Threatening staff such as teachers, who already have a difficult and challenging job, that they will be held accountable for failing to spot any warning signs of violent crime is an unacceptable response and will simply add to the myriad of government-driven factors which are causing teachers to leave the profession and deterring potential recruits from applying.” Addressing claims that school exclusions may be linked to knife crime, Keates said: “It is concerning that a narrative appears to be developing whereby schools excluding pupils are potentially being scapegoated as being part of the problem, with exclusion being cited as a reason for pupils becoming involved in knife crime and gangs. “Schools exclude as a last resort and it should be remembered that exclusions in too many instances are because pupils have brought offensive weapons on site or have engaged in violence against staff and other pupils.” Keates said it was becoming increasingly difficult for teachers to manage challenging behaviour in schools. “There have been savage cuts by government to local authority funding, which has resulted in either the severe reduction or the disappearance altogether of specialist external support, including appropriate referral units on which schools have been able in the past to rely.” Between March 2017 and March 2018 there were 285 killings using a knife or sharp instrument in England and Wales – the highest number since Home Office records began in 1946. The number has risen four years in a row after a long-term decline.",Education
"G4S stripped of contract to run Birmingham prison G4S is to be permanently stripped of its contract to run Birmingham prison after the government was forced to take control of the failing jail. The Ministry of Justice took the unprecedented step of seizing control of the prison last August, removing its governor and moving out hundreds of prisoners, hours before a severely critical report was published by the prisons inspectorate. Ministers had hoped to restore management of the prison to G4S, which operates four other major prisons in the UK, but after extending the takeover in February to the end of summer, have decided to terminate the contract. The prisons minister, Rory Stewart, said: “I am confident that HMP Birmingham has made good progress since the ‘step-in’ but to build on this, the prison needs stability and continuity. That is why we have mutually agreed with G4S that the public sector is better placed to drive the long-term improvements required and the contract will end.” In August, the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said there had been a “dramatic deterioration” since the last inspection in early 2017 and the government should launch an urgent inquiry into the state of the prison, the most violent in England and Wales and the site of riots in 2016. The state of the category B prison reignited the debate over for-profit prisons debate and the involvement of the private sector in the running of jails. Stewart said: “We need to be absolutely clear that we still believe in a mixed economy of providers with some of our private prisons among the best performing in the country. Indeed, G4S itself is running excellent prisons at Altcourse and Oakwood, and this government believes passionately that private providers should continue to play a crucial role in our system.” As part of the decision to bring HMP Birmingham back into the public sector, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) has agreed a settlement, with G4S paying £9.9m to cover the additional cost of the “step-in” action. G4S staff at Birmingham will transfer to HMPPS contracts on 1 July and the governor, Paul Newton, who took command of the prison last August at the time of the takeover, will stay in the job. Jerry Petherick, the custodial and detention services managing director of G4S, said: “HMP Birmingham is an inner-city remand prison which faces exceptional challenges including high levels of prisoner violence towards staff and fellow prisoners. “We believe that it is in the best interests of staff and the company that management of this prison is transferred to HMPPS and we will work closely with the Ministry of Justice to ensure a smooth transition over the next three months.”",Society
"Why is Channel 4 apologising for Jon Snow’s ‘white people’ remark? ‘It’s been the most extraordinary day,” the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow remarked on air on Friday, referring to the pro-Brexit protesters flooding the centre of London. “A day which has seen … I have never seen so many white people in one place; it’s an extraordinary story.” Predictably, perhaps, the reference to “white people” led to a backlash online, with some viewers taking it as an insult and others even calling the veteran broadcaster a “racist”. “We are all sick to death of Jon Snow’s blatant bias, condescension and fake news”, wrote Nigel Farage, while tweeting a photo of a black man in a union jack bowler hat being stared down by a white anti-Brexit campaigner, as if an audition for a Benetton ad had gone terribly wrong. With the regulator Ofcom said to be calculating how many complaints it has received over the comment, Channel 4 News has now apologised. The statement it issued is worth dissecting: it noted that this “was a spontaneous comment” reflecting Snow’s “observation that in a London demonstration of that size, ethnic minorities seemed to be significantly under-represented”, while saying it regrets “any offence caused by his comment”. It is essentially an apology for offending people with facts. This is where we are now: a white person in trouble for calling other people white; a news organisation apologising for telling the truth. The reality is, the leave march appeared predominantly white (which is clearly not the same as saying no BAME person wants to leave the EU), and it is entirely legitimate for a journalist to say so. In fact, it’s part of our job – examining race, sex and class helps us all understand the political climate better, just as thinking about the role of minorities and marginalised groups helps us question power, values and representation. That Snow’s remarks caused such a fuss is a perfect display of how race inequality works. It is a reflection of white privilege that white people like me are so rarely defined by race that being referred to by our own skin colour is perceived as a personal affront. We are used to being seen and spoken about as individuals rather than a homogenous group – a privilege ethnic minorities are much less likely to enjoy in day-to-day life. There is also a fragile double standard to it. Did all the people claiming white people’s race is irrelevant in an anti-Brexit march kick up a fuss when Sajid Javid spoke of “Asian paedophiles” or when Catherine Blaiklock, the former Ukip activist, said that black men are violent due to high testosterone? (In fact, Farage worked with her.) Rather than giving air to the frenzied complaints about Snow, it is worth thinking about why people such as Farage are so motivated to make them. Resisting accusations of being unrepresentative is a classic tactic of political groups who want to suggest they speak for the wider public; “pro-life” campaigners during the Irish referendum, for example, were accused of putting young people at the front of photos so it appeared that anti-abortion opinion went beyond the elderly. But, more than this, cries of “white racism” play perfectly into the manufactured culture war that an increasing number of careers feed off. It suits Farage and co very well to suggest that “the establishment” is out to get them, that the white majority are actually the persecuted group. Just look at the speed with which rightwing accounts, contrarian commentators and fringe politicians rushed to Twitter to express their outrage over Snow’s remark. Just as it is the new normal for the “alt-right” to whip up a crowd outside parliament with talk of “betrayal”, so social media is a breeding ground for persecution complexes and toxic racial division.

"China cracks down on fentanyl after US pleads Beijing for action on opioids China has announced it will crack down on all fentanyl-like substances, following US pleas for Beijing to control a drug fuelling a deadly opioid crisis. But a senior official repeated China’s denial of responsibility for the US’s deadly opioid crisis, which he blamed instead on American culture. “Some people link drug consumption with freedom, individuality and liberation,” said Liu Yuejin, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission. “If the United States truly wants to resolve its fentanyl abuse problem, it needs to strengthen its domestic work.” China is suspected of being the main source of a powerful painkiller 50 times stronger than heroin that has caused record overdose deaths in the United States. Fentanyl has been tied to already tense bilateral relations, with the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, saying he hopes to include China’s commitments to curb the drug in any agreement to end the two countries’ bitter trade war. In December, Trump said the move against the “horror drug” could be a “game changer” because China has the death penalty for major narcotics offences. By designating all fentanyl analogues as controlled substances from 1 May, China aims to prevent smugglers from skirting the law by changing formulas to make drugs similar to the painkiller. Liu told reporters that US concerns had been “resolved. All resolved.” But Liu repeated China’s denial of responsibility for the US’s deadly opioid crisis, saying US allegations of large scale trafficking from China “lack evidence and are contrary to the facts”. “We believe that the United States itself is the main factor in the abuse of fentanyl there,” Liu said, adding that American culture was partly to blame. Liu said China “cannot possibly be the major source to the US”. Instead, Liu blamed American’s abuse of prescription opioids, pharmaceutical industry influence, US pharmacies and doctors’ “excessive prescription”, lax enforcement and American culture conflating drugs with “freedom, individuality and liberation”. “If the US really wants to resolve the fentanyl substance problem, they have more work to do domestically,” he said. A US congressional inquiry into the use of fentanyl in the United States found in 2018 that the substance could easily be bought online from Chinese “labs” and mailed to the United States. Liu said Chinese authorities will urge courier companies to implement real-name registration for parcels, stepping up customs checks for high-risk international packages and enhancing enforcement co-operation. Mike Vigil, former head of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration said that the measures announced on Monday would have a major impact, but he agreed that “corporate greed in pharmaceutical industry” and overprescription of opioids had driven a lot of the epidemic in the US. “If China stems the movement of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids to the United States it would have a huge impact, but it would not stop the epidemic,” he said.",World news
"Charles Leclerc’s Bahrain brilliance heralds start of a new dynamic in F1 Charles Leclerc took the crushing disappointment of losing an almost certain maiden Formula One win at the Bahrain Grand Prix with the impressive stoicism of a veteran. He is 21 years old and more experienced drivers have crumbled or erupted in similar circumstances. That Leclerc bore it with such broad shoulders and sophistication reflected a driver who knows that it is only a matter of time before he does take victory. But more than that his performance and reaction to the setback may well herald the beginning of a new dynamic in F1. The young Monégasque, in only his second season in F1 and his second race for Ferrari, was comfortably leading at the Sakhir circuit when what transpired to be a cylinder problem cost him power. He was reeled in by Lewis Hamilton, who went on to win, while Leclerc limped home in third, a first podium finish that was cold comfort. Leclerc paused for a moment before climbing from the cockpit, gathering his thoughts and emerged to declare it was just part of racing. “Today was not our day,” he said. “It is sad. I was so close to realising a dream. But hopefully this day will come one day in the future.” It will, without doubt. Every step he had made to that moment across the weekend had been hugely impressive. Bahrain had belonged to Leclerc. He was quickest in two of the three practice sessions, second only to his teammate Sebastian Vettel on Friday afternoon. He then blitzed the four-time world champion in qualifying, taking pole position with a lap three-tenths quicker than the German. In the race, after a poor start that was his only slip dropped him to third, composure and a clinical recovery followed. He passed Valtteri Bottas and then flew after Vettel. He was quicker but the team told him to hold position for two laps. However, he saw an opportunity and took it decisively at turn four. Other inexperienced or indeed less hungry drivers might have felt holding station to their senior teammate would be in order. Leclerc simply saw a chance and grabbed it and the lead. In the final act, as his power bled away, the focus remained, with Leclerc instantly putting the disappointment behind him in recognising there were still points to be had. The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff’s take on it was illuminating. “Very, very impressive,” he said. “He has a good personality. He is a humble young man and he is very fast. To have the combination of the speed, the personality and being able to temper your emotions in both directions is a great ingredient. “I know many other drivers who have the lion in them, as he has, would have reacted in a different way and been angry and would have displayed that. And we didn’t see that.” In stark contrast Vettel, whose internal lion is on occasion released from its cage especially under pressure, was left considering another driver error that proved costly. He spun as Hamilton pulled off a fine pass on lap 38. With his tyres shot and then losing his front wing, Vettel finished in fifth. The error compounded mistakes he made last season that cost him a shot at the title. Vettel admitted it was his fault but Hamilton was sympathetic. “It happens to all of us,” he said. “Just because you are a multiple world champion does not mean you are not going to have off weekends.” The trouble is that Vettel has comparatively far more and far more costly off weekends than Hamilton and much as he talks up his rival, Hamilton knows it. Across their respective performances over the last two seasons it is almost impossible now not to perceive that Hamilton absolutely has the measure of Vettel. Leclerc’s bravura display in Bahrain brings an entire other level to their battle. Ferrari must consider that they have in him a driver who will charge for the win, is entirely unintimidated by his teammate and it seems is willing to ignore team orders. How they manage it is a major issue, as is how Vettel will react should he be beaten regularly by Leclerc. In 2014, when Daniel Ricciardo did just that at Red Bull, the German did not take to it with great equanimity. Hamilton praised Leclerc’s performance, acknowledging that the weekend had been his but for misfortune. He already knew how good the young driver could be and, now it has been proved definitively, it is perfectly conceivable that Hamilton will consider Leclerc the greater threat. “I haven’t had a wheel-to-wheel battle with him but I will at some stage I am sure,” he said. It is a fight that seems as inevitable as Leclerc taking that maiden win and a thrilling, vital new dimension to F1.",Sport
"Erdoğan’s grip on Turkey slips as opposition makes election gains Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s grip on the country has been challenged by a resurgent opposition in local elections, with his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) losing control of Ankara and on track to lose Istanbul, according to unofficial local election results. Voting in 30 cities, 51 municipal capitals and 922 districts across the country on Sunday has been viewed widely as a referendum on the president’s handling of Turkey’s economic crisis as the nation of 81 million people faces a recession for the first time since Erdoğan entered office 16 years ago. It is also a litmus test for whether the Turkish leader is willing to use his newly expanded presidential powers and increasing appetite for authoritarian measures to secure AKP dominance in the country’s two major cities. Voters in Ankara, the capital, delivered a definitive blow to the government coalition on Sunday, wrenching the city out of the control of Islamist parties for the first time in 25 years. Erdoğan’s beloved Istanbul, his hometown and where he began his political career as mayor in 1994, looks set to follow. The AKP loss in Ankara to the secular Republican People’s party (CHP) mayoral candidate, Mansur Yavaş, sent shockwaves through the rest of the country. The AKP said it would appeal. In Istanbul on Monday, an agonising wait for the first results in the city’s mayoral race is still not over. At one point the AKP candidate, former prime minister Binali Yıldırım, and the opposition candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu, tied at 48.7% of the vote each with 98.8% of the ballots counted, before İmamoğlu inched ahead with a lead of 0.28 percentage points. Erdoğan flew back to Istanbul from Ankara on Monday evening, where he is believed to be meeting with Yıldırım, the city’s governor and the head of Istanbul’s police force. On Monday morning, posters of the president alongside Yıldırım thanking Istanbullus for their votes had already been plastered on billboards around the city, but an initial declaration of victory the night before was premature. İmamoğlu, the CHP coalition candidate, also declared himself mayor of Istanbul on Monday, as Yıldırım refused to concede, citing 300,000 invalid votes for the CHP, a margin that could give AKP victory. The official results may not arrive for days. The opposition’s predicted gains come despite enormous obstacles: an almost completely pro-government media bias, allegations of AKP vote-rigging and a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in the majority Kurdish south-east of the country on terror charges ahead of polling day. “The people have voted in favour of democracy, they have chosen democracy,” said the CHP leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. The results – if they are not contested or opposition winners removed from their posts and caretaker officials installed – would mark the first lasting check on Erdoğan’s consolidation of power since he became prime minister in 2003. Liberal neighbourhoods of Istanbul were tense but jubilant on Monday, with people in cafes glued to live election results on television. “I see İmamoğlu becoming the head of the CHP and then prime minister of this country,” said Murat Sun, 38. “He will have to fight hard because the government still holds the power and they will create problems for him. But I am still very hopeful.” Local elections do not normally deliver such watershed moments, but the catalyst for Sunday’s unexpected results has been Turkey’s faltering economy. Unemployment is rising and with inflation at 20% the cost of living has soared. Last month Turkey officially entered a recession, ending years of strong economic growth that has helped Erdoğan stay in office. In an attempt to curry favour with his base of working-class voters, the president opened cut-price “people’s vegetables” stalls a few weeks before the elections. He has been on the campaign trail for weeks, sometimes speaking eight times a day to rallies of more than 1 million people, framing the local elections as a matter of “national survival” and accusing opposition parties of links to terrorism. But with no general election scheduled until 2023, the decisions on mayors, municipal assembly leaders and neighbourhood administrators around Turkey on Sunday also became a vote on his leadership. Turkey’s voter turnout is among the highest in the world, and stood at 87% in last year’s general election. Opposition hopes that dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of Turkey’s economy since last year’s currency crash would prevent AKP voters from turning up at polling stations appeared to be well-founded. “In Turkey, people support political parties like they’re football teams. But we still have a conscience. The fire has spread from the kitchen now. People see the queues for onions,” said Oznur Turunk, 66. “Every authoritarian government only lasts for a certain time period, so this was coming.” Sunday’s election has also rocked Istanbul’s conservative working-class neighbourhoods – traditionally, AKP strongholds. Men sitting outside an AKP building in Tophane next to the Bosphorus on Monday afternoon shook their heads as they read newspapers and discussed the mayoral race. “Turkey has a robust and deep belief in democratic structures and civil society is very resilient. Despite the last 16 years, that is still there,” said Lisel Hintz, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s European and Eurasian studies department. “The question is: how many people are tired of Erdoĝan’s message at this juncture?” Despite the seismic results in Turkey’s major urban centres, the ruling AKP and an allied nationalist party still won more than half of the votes across Turkey as a whole. The pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP) regained several seats across the mainly Kurdish south-east, where the government has replaced elected mayors with government-appointed trustees in the past after alleging the ousted officials had links to the outlawed militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), but also lost two south-eastern towns to AKP control. The high stakes were reflected by reports that four people had been killed in election-related violence. For many people, memories of alleged results massaging and government tampering with the electoral roll in 2015’s general election are still fresh. It is feared Istanbul’s race may not be declared until the AKP feels it can justifiably eke out a victory. As they stand, the reported results will also cause a headache for Erdoĝan inside his party, fuelling rumours of a breakaway party split within the AKP. They will also frustrate international businesses and diplomatic partners who assumed Ankara would be able to refocus on issues such as rebuilding international investor confidence and the next steps in Syria’s civil war once the campaign was over. “In 2015, Erdogan called a new round of snap elections and restarted the war with the PKK to stoke national insecurity and get the general election result he wanted,” said Kimberly Guiler, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government’s Middle East Initiative. “He has shown that he is not above minimising or negating opposition wins somehow. This is a checkmate. Let’s see what he does next.”",World news
"EasyJet warns of slow summer sales amid Brexit uncertainty EasyJet expects profits for 2019 to be hit by falling demand as it blamed economic uncertainty and Brexit for spooking passengers. The airline said it was more cautious about the summer after weaker ticket sales in the UK and across Europe. Airlines and holiday firms have reduced prices because of the UK’s prolonged and uncertain withdrawal from the EU. In a trading update, easyJet confirmed the revenue generated per passenger had declined by 7.4%, in line with previous warnings, and it expected first-half losses of about £275m. The chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the UK’s departure from the EU would affect trading over the next six months. “For the second half we are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit, which are together driving weaker customer demand.” Although overall revenues have increased because easyJet has flown more planes, that additional capacity has pushed down fares while fuel and other costs have risen. The carrier said there was an additional £37m cost for fuel, while the weakness of the pound had cost it another £8m. EasyJet said it would be “flying as usual” whatever happened with Brexit, as a result of recent EU legislation and British commitments to ensure flights continued between the UK and Europe. It recently set up a Vienna-based airline and transferred many of its fleet and crew licences to European equivalents to keep them operating. The carrier has also increased its non-UK shareholding to meet European ownership requirements. EU regulations require that airlines flying under a European licence must be majority-owned and controlled by shareholders from the trading bloc. Lundgren said the airline had performed in line with expectations: “We have flown around 42 million customers with a significantly reduced number of cancellations and continued high levels of customer satisfaction. “We are operationally well-prepared for Brexit. Now that the EU parliament has passed its air connectivity legislation and together with the UK’s confirmation that it will reciprocate, means that whatever happens, we’ll be flying as usual.” While easyJet’s losses are significantly higher than the £68m fall into the red in the first half of 2018, the airline’s performance a year ago was unusually strong, benefiting from difficulties experienced by its biggest competitor, Ryanair, and the collapse of Monarch, as well as an earlier Easter. Ryanair said in February it did not expect air fares to rise to normal levels in the summer, blaming an excess of capacity in the short-haul airline sector. It plans to price seats at a level that will fill its planes, which it says will lead to lower fares. Although Brexit uncertainty and a surplus of seats are denting airline profits, passengers have been finding relative bargains compared with previous years. Package holidays and flights departing the UK in April, when Britain could still potentially leave the EU without a deal, have been sold up to a third cheaper than last Easter. According to Travelsupermarket, holiday companies have slashed prices for trips to destinations including Malta, Sardinia and the Algarve. Flights next month from London to Spain for as little as £10 each way were still available on the Ryanair website on Monday. A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents said while travel companies had taken strong forward bookings for the summer at the end of 2018, Brexit was “creating uncertainty across the board” and a slowdown in bookings had been reported among the organisation’s members. Despite reassurances that flights would operate, potential holidaymakers have been warned about the validity of passports and other essential travel documentation, such as green cards for car insurance and entitlement to the European health insurance card.",Business
"Google employees call for removal of rightwing thinktank leader from AI council A group of Google employees have called for the removal of a rightwing thinktank leader from the company’s new artificial intelligence council, citing her anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant record. Employees published a letter on Monday criticizing the appointment of Kay Coles James, the president of the Heritage Foundation, to Google’s newly formed advisory council for “the responsible development of AI”. James has a history of fighting trans rights and LGBT protections, and has advocated for Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. “In selecting James, Google is making clear that its version of ‘ethics’ values proximity to power over the wellbeing of trans people, other LGBTQ people and immigrants,” the employees wrote in the letter, which was published online and shared internally at the company. “Such a position directly contravenes Google’s stated values.” The letter was posted on Medium Monday morning and said it came from more than 50 Google employees, who remained anonymous. Within hours, hundreds had signed on. The letter was also signed by dozens of prominent academics and activists, including Joy Buolamwini, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, Meredith Whittaker, the co-founder of the AI Now Institute at NYU, and the author Naomi Klein. Google faced backlash last week when it announced that James was one of the “diverse perspectives” it was bringing together for a council dedicated to advising on ethical questions related to facial recognition and machine learning. The other seven members included computer science and mathematics experts, a privacy researcher, a drone company chief executive and a former US diplomat. The company described James as a “public policy expert with extensive experience working at the local, state and federal levels of government”, saying she focuses on “free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom and national defense” at the Heritage Foundation. James, who was director of the United States Office of Personnel Management under the former president George W Bush, has recently fought the Equality Act, a federal anti-discrimination measure, and has taken vocal stance against abortion rights. She has also advocated against basic recognition for trans people. The Heritage Foundation is an influential Washington DC-based thinktank that has close ties to the Trump administration. “Google cannot claim to support trans people and its trans employees – a population that faces real and material threats – and simultaneously appoint someone committed to trans erasure to a key AI advisory position,” said the letter by employees.. The letter noted that the “potential harms of AI are not evenly distributed, and follow historical patterns of discrimination and exclusion”. It cited examples of AI that has failed to recognize trans people, does not “hear” more feminine voices and does not “see” women of color. Research has consistently shown that algorithms, facial recognition and other automated systems can replicate and amplify biases, a growing concern as AI is used in the criminal justice system, education, government surveillance, the financial sector and more. Employees at Google have increasingly engaged in activism and labor organizing, most notably with massive global walkouts to protest against sexual misconduct last year and a worker-led campaign to stop Google building a censored search engine for China. Google ignored the Guardian’s repeated requests for comment last week, regarding the appointment of James. Spokespeople for the Heritage Foundation and Google did not immediately respond to inquiries about the letter. The employees also said it was wrong to cite James’s appointment as an example of “diversity of thought”, writing: “This is a weaponization of the language of diversity. “By appointing James … Google elevates and endorses her views, implying that hers is a valid perspective worthy of inclusion in its decision making.”",Technology
"US will run out of avocados in three weeks if Trump closes Mexico border US consumers would run out of avocados in three weeks if Donald Trump makes good on his threat to close down the US–Mexico border. Trump said on Friday that there was a “very good likelihood” he would close the border this week if Mexico did not stop immigrants from reaching the United States. But a complete shutdown would disrupt millions of legal border crossings in addition to asylum seekers, as well as billions of dollars in trade, about $137bn of which is in food imports. From the avocados on avocado toast, to the limes and tequila in margaritas, the US is heavily reliant on Mexican imports of fruit, vegetables and alcohol to meet consumer demand. Nearly half of all imported US vegetables and 40% of imported fruit are grown in Mexico, according to the latest data from the United States Department of Agriculture. Avocados would run out in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped, said Steve Barnard, president and chief executive of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world. “You couldn’t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100% of the avocados in the US right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they’re not relevant right now and won’t be for another month or so,” said Barnard. Monica Ganley, principal at Quarterra, a consultancy specializing in Latin American agricultural issues and trade, said that a border closure would inevitably hit consumers. “We’re absolutely going to see higher prices. This is a very real and very relevant concern for American consumers.” The US and Mexico trade about $1.7bn in goods daily, according to the US Chamber of Commerce, which said closing the border would be “an unmitigated economic debacle” that would threaten 5m American jobs. The effects of a shutdown would run both ways. Mexico is the largest importer of US exports of refined fuels like diesel and gasoline, some of which moves by rail. It is unclear if rail terminals would be affected by closures. As changing palates have increased demand for fresh produce, and a greater variety of it, the United States has increasingly come to depend on Mexico to meet that need. Imports have nearly tripled since 1999. In that period, Mexico has gone from supplying less than a third of imported produce to 44% today. In addition to avocados, the majority of imported tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries and raspberries come from Mexico. While there are other producers of these goods globally, opening those trade channels would take time, said Ganley.",US news
"What do Andrew Marr’s paintings tell us about his views on Brexit? Andrew Marr says making art in your leisure time is a source of wellbeing and has written movingly about sketching after his stroke. So there’s a poignancy in the way the nightmare of Brexit infects his latest paintings of Highland landscapes and circuses. As an eminent BBC journalist, Marr can’t really speak his mind on the issue paralysing and splintering the nation, but there is no rule against artistic expressionism. So Brexit symbols have danced into his pictures. Gold stars on blue in one of them look to me like a sign that his heart lies in Europe. The more you look at this painting, the more unequivocally it celebrates European civilisation. As well as gold stars, a gold figure dances wildly in the big blue EU yonder. Marr has mixed a reference to the EU flag with a homage to Matisse’s cut-out image Icarus, of a figure against a blue sky studded with gold stars. Mr Marr, who do you think you’re fooling? There is nothing subtle about this. It is a painted love letter to the EU and to the greatness of European art. Look longer still and it’s clear he is heartbroken. Matisse’s Icarus depicts a stricken, bloodied airman falling to disaster. Marr’s golden dancer has a river of blood spewing from it. The joy is undercut by pain. Brexit is a tragedy. Marr shows all this as a painting within a painting, with his own spattered palettes in the foreground. He is mourning Europe by painting it – thinking of Matisse, and war, and the Fall of Icarus. Our national crisis improves Marr’s paintings. Sigmund Freud claimed creativity is a sublimation of repressed thoughts. He was talking about sex, but what aboutpolitical views? Marr has turned his position to his advantage. Forbidden to declare his view of a topic that dominates his work life, those pent up feelings intensify his art. Still, he paints to get away from all that. Not all his new paintings are tempestuous meditations on the Europe we’re losing. A lot depict the River Gruinard in Wester Ross, a favourite haunt far from the madding news cycle. He loses himself in speckles of foam and leaves. You can’t blame him for seeking reassurance in nature.",Media
"Italy may scrap vaccine certificates for young children Italy may scrap its requirement for parents to provide proof that their children have been vaccinated before they start nursery. The senate’s health committee is expected to pass an amendment dropping the obligation next week, sparking further controversy over the populist coalition government’s ambiguous vaccine policy. The measure would then be put to parliament. The amendment was signed by Pierpaolo Sileri, the committee’s president and a senator with the Five Star Movement (M5S), and the vice-president, Maria Cristina Cantù, a senator with the far-right League. The change to the current law, which denies unvaccinated children access to nurseries, was reportedly drafted without the knowledge of Giulia Grillo, the M5S health minister. She is yet to comment publicly on the amendment. Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the League, recently wrote to Grillo asking that unvaccinated children be allowed to attend nursery, after hundreds were turned away because their parents had not provided a doctor’s certificate. “I don’t want B-series children,” he said. “We need to organise ourselves, we can’t have children left outside the door.” Two M5S politicians, Elena Fattori and Giorgio Trizzino, have called for the amendment to be withdrawn, arguing that children’s health must not be sacrificed for the sake of political ambitions. “The reason for requiring certificates is because there are children aged 0-6 who have not yet completed the vaccine cycle, and this has an impact on children’s health, especially those who are more vulnerable,” Fattori told the Guardian. “The amendment doesn’t remove the vaccines obligation itself, just the need to provide certificates, therefore it seems like a political ploy to appeal to the anti-vax campaigners.” The obligation to provide certificates took effect in early March as part of a law introduced by the former centre-left administration that made it compulsory to be vaccinated against 10 diseases, including measles. That law is under debate but, until broader changes are made, it remains in place. This in itself has caused confusion among parents. “Instead of sending out an ambiguous message, the government should be formulating a serious information strategy,” Fattori said. “Especially at this dangerous moment, citizens need to know the importance of vaccines.” Fattori cited the case of a 20-day-old baby who died of whooping cough a few days ago. Pregnant women are advised to protect their babies by getting vaccinated between the 16th and 32nd week of pregnancy. A Guardian analysis of WHO data published in December showed that measles cases in Europe rose above 60,000 in 2018 – more than double that of 2017 and the highest this century. Health experts have warned that vaccine sceptics are driving down immunisation rates for measles, HPV against cervical cancer, flu and other diseases, and that their opinions are being amplified by social media and by rightwing populists equally sceptical of medical authorities. M5S has long promoted scepticism over vaccines, and has made several U-turns on the policy since coming to power with the League last June. The League has also questioned the safety of vaccines. “There is a lot of confusion,” said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology at Milan’s Vita-Salute San Raffaele University and prominent pro-vaccination campaigner. “For once there is a law that is working; vaccination coverage in all regions has increased dramatically, and it would be a pity to dismantle it.”",World news
"Venezuela: Maduro calls on armed groups to keep order amid electricity rationing Venezuela’s authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro has called on armed pro-government groups to help subdue unrest as he announced a 30-day electricity rationing plan set to inflict further pain on the population. In a televised address, Maduro said he had no choice but to take drastic measures while his government rebuilt key sections of Venezuela’s national grid following a succession of crippling power failures since 7 March. Experts and Maduro’s political opponents say the repeated collapse of Venezuela’s electricity system – which has left millions without light or water – is a consequence of years of neglect, corruption and incompetence. But in his late-night appearance Maduro repeated the Socialist party line that Venezuela had suffered a series of “brutish attacks” masterminded by his political opponents and their supporters in the White House. “We are facing a group of monsters who want to destroy Venezuela,” Maduro said, claiming their aim was to topple his government by “making the people and the country go mad”. Amid growing fears that Venezuela’s crisis could be moving into a violent new phase, Maduro instructed “revolutionary and patriotic” government supporters and armed pro-government gangs known as colectivos to mobilize “to defend the peace of every barrio, of every block”. “They will not take away our peace,” Maduro vowed. Last week Maduro’s second-in-command, Diosdado Cabello, appeared in a menacing video flanked by dozens of masked men and women who he referred to as “peace defenders” but who many fear have been tasked with violently repressing dissent. There were signs on Sunday that such groups had begun responding to the government’s calls. As further blackouts struck Venezuela and citizens took to the streets to protest, photographs and videos circulated appearing to show armed men confronting demonstrators in the capital, Caracas. Two protesters were reported to have been shot after burning blockades were set up in streets near the presidential palace. “We’re here fighting for water and power, we’ve gone twenty-some days without water,” Yofre Gamez, 32, told Reuters as shots rang out. In the western state of Zulia, perhaps the worst affected by the electricity crisis, opposition leaders claimed a 70-year-old woman had been shot dead by members of one colectivo during a protest. Footage also circulated on social media that appeared to show paramilitaries and police special forces searching a housing estate for protesters in Barquisimeto, Venezuela’s fourth largest city. Maduro’s challenger, Juan Guaidó, claimed such paramilitary groups were trying – but failing – to suppress popular opposition to Hugo Chávez’s successor, who has led Venezuela into economic crisis. “We must stay strong and stay in the streets,” tweeted Guaidó, who most western governments have recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. The Venezuelan human rights group Provea said Maduro’s so-called “peace squads” were actually paramilitary gangs tasked with spreading violence and shooting protesters. “Maduro’s peace means violence against the people,” Provea said. As Venezuelans braced for weeks of hardship and uncertainty, Maduro urged them to have faith in his government – and in God. “God must accompany us with his blessings in this, the most difficult of battles that we must face,” Maduro said, before being applauded by senior political and military leaders.",World news
"May’s failure to tackle Tory Islamophobia sends a dangerous message Theresa May and the Conservative party are refusing to take the action needed to tackle the growing problem of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment among Tory members and politicians, and in our wider society. At a time when hate crime against all minority communities is rising, and when far-right extremism is a growing problem, they simply must not be allowed to get away with it. Just over two weeks ago, people around the world were left heartbroken and scared when 50 innocent people were murdered in a terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, for no reason other than their faith. This horrific attack was motivated by Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment. But, sadly, these views are no longer held by extremists alone. Over recent years, they have crept into mainstream society and political debate. Everyone who cares about protecting our diversity and liberal, inclusive societies must act immediately to stamp it out. There is no denying that here in Britain the Conservative party has a particular problem with Islamophobia. Just last week, 15 suspended Conservative councillors were quietly reinstated, despite evidence showing they had posted or shared Islamophobic or racist material. And, in December, a Conservative party complaints panel found that Boris Johnson’s comparison of women wearing burqas to letterboxes and bank robbers had been “respectful”. The impact this has on ordinary British Muslims cannot be overstated. It sends a message that it is totally acceptable to mock women who wear a burqa, and that blatantly anti-Muslim racist abuse deserves a slap on the wrist at most. It has left communities across Britain feeling insecure and afraid of what the future might hold. I have personally been subjected to abuse based on my faith by people at all levels of the Conservative party. Several Conservative members and councillors have been suspended or arrested or have faced legal action as a result of Islamophobic abuse directed at me, and I have never received an explanation let alone an apology for the openly Islamophobic campaign the party ran against me in London in 2016. This didn’t just involve the Tory mayoral candidate, but extended to unacceptable attacks by a range of senior ministers – including the current prime minister. And it hasn’t stopped since. Just last year, the current Conservative London mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, shared an image online that described me as the “mad mullah” of “Londonistan”. He faced no investigation or action from the Conservative party whatsoever, despite having previously said that accommodating Muslims and Hindus “robs Britain of its community” and risks turning our country into a “crime-riddled cesspool”. Similarly, no action was taken against the Conservative MP Michael Fabricant, when he shared a different vile Islamophobic picture of me. The impact of incidents such as this isn’t about me – it creates much bigger problems. When the party in government sees no need to put its own house in order it sends the damaging message to wider society that Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment are acceptable. It also sends a destructive message to young British Muslims about the abuse and racism they could face if they dare to pursue a role in politics or in the public eye. That’s why I wrote to Theresa May last week to ask her to adopt a new cross-party definition of Islamophobia. The new definition was produced by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on British Muslims, following a six-month consultation with MPs, academics, legal experts, Muslim organisations and representatives of other faiths. It has already been accepted by the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, an increasing number of councils and me at City Hall. The Conservative party has refused to adopt the new definition. The prime minister, asked directly if she would adopt it in the House of Commons on Wednesday, pointedly refused to answer the question. Instead, she sent the Conservative vice chair, James Cleverly, to do TV interviews to deny that an agreed definition of Islamophobia even exists. The prime minister has also repeatedly refused to launch an investigation into Islamophobia in her party, despite calls to do so from a wide range of senior Tory politicians, including the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi. The Tories cannot be allowed to keep get away with this. May pledged to tackle the “burning injustice” of racism when she became prime minister. If she is serious, then she must start by rooting out Islamophobia within her own party. That means adopting the APPG definition of Islamophobia for both the Conservative party and the government. Secondly, it means giving a firm commitment to investigate properly all Conservative party members and politicians accused of Islamophobic incidents. And thirdly, it means launching an independent investigation into Islamophobia into her party and implementing its recommendations. Racism, hatred and division of all types are sadly on the rise in Britain and across the world. These are dangerous times for all who care about diversity and tolerance. Everyone in public life has a responsibility to tackle it head on wherever we see it. I have never shirked this responsibility as mayor of London, loudly challenging all forms of racism – including the foul antisemitism that has become all too common within the Labour party. It’s now time for the prime minister to do the same, and to take on the poisonous Islamophobia within her own ranks. • Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London",Opinion
"Scientists uncover potential source of methane on Mars A waft of methane detected by Nasa’s Curiosity rover on Mars may have been released from a layer of permafrost containing bubbles of the gas that was fractured by a geological event, researchers have said. It is the first time scientists have identified a potential source of methane on Mars, though the scientific community is still divided on whether the gas is really produced on the planet at all. Some says the methane detections on Mars are spurious or have come from other sources such as the rover itself. On 16 June 2013, instruments on Curiosity recorded a spike in methane in the Gale crater, a 96-mile-wide bowl where the rover landed in August 2012. Since then, it has found evidence of seasonal variations in methane, with levels of the gas rising and falling with the Martian summers and winters. The apparent presence of methane on Mars has fuelled intense speculation that the gas could emanate from microbial Martians beneath the surface, though a more prosaic explanation points to a reaction between olivine rocks and water. Both processes release the gas on Earth. In the latest study, Marco Giuranna and colleagues at the National Institute of Astrophysics in Rome turned to an instrument on the European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter to look for more evidence of methane on Mars. The scientists used the orbiter’s planetary fourier spectrometer (PFS) to look for methane in and around Gale crater from December 2012 to July 2014. The instrument spotted methane only once, on the same day Curiosity detected the sudden spike in the gas. “Our finding constitutes the first independent confirmation of a methane detection,” Giuranna said. “Prior to our study, methane detections on Mars, being either in situ, from orbit, or from Earth-based telescopes, were not confirmed by independent observations.” While the Curiosity rover measured a methane concentration of 5.78 parts per billion (ppb) in Gale crater on 16 June 2013, the Mars Express instrument recorded 15.5ppb in the column of atmosphere above the crater, the scientists report in Nature Geoscience. In an attempt to trace the source of the methane, the scientists divided up a wide region around Gale crater into a grid with squares 250km on each side. Researchers at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy in Brussels used computer models to simulate one million different emission scenarios in each square. Meanwhile, geologists in the US and Italy scrutinised the region around the crater for features that might release methane. “Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane, which is situated about 500km east of Gale,” said Giuranna. The location, known as Aeolis Mensae, has a number of geological faults that may have fractured nearby permafrost and released any methane trapped inside. Alternatively, incoming meteorites might have broken the ice open. The study does not speculate about the ultimate origin of methane on Mars, but Giuranna said homing in on a source was the first step towards an answer. Even if microbes were not the culprit, he said, the gas would make the planet more habitable because it could be used as a source of carbon and energy. Humans could also potentially make use of methane trapped beneath the Martian soil to make chemicals and rocket fuel. The results are likely to stoke the debate on the existence of Martian methane. In December, researchers working on the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) said they had not detected any methane in the Martian atmosphere since the spacecraft arrived in orbit in 2016. Their findings suggest methane releases are extremely rare and that the gas swiftly disappears. “The findings are somewhat of a surprise,” said Manish Patel, an Open University researcher who works on the TGO mission. “Comparing these results to what we see with the specifically designed methane hunting instruments on TGO will tell us a lot.” The TGO mission, which could potentially distinguish between microbial and geological sources of methane, will release its results next week. “The verification of the Curiosity observations by the PFS instrument certainly gives us a lot to think about,” said Patel. “Let’s just say it will make for an interesting discussion in the community as we seek to resolve the observations from existing and new measurements of methane on Mars. “As always, Mars and the scientists that study it still have plenty of surprises up their sleeves.”",Science
"Chomping down on bait proffered by famously subtle goading OH FITBA! The Fiver’s bagpipes-playing, kilt-wearing, deep-fried haggis-eating Scottish cousin Shortbread McFiver was rudely awoken on Monday morning by the ferocious din of black metal-loving scaffolders across the street, banging, clanging and listening to the monster riffola of Gorgoroth as they went about their work outside his bothy. At least that’s what Shortbread thought until he looked and realised there was no sign of any builders – he’d actually just come around in a ditch in Kazakhstan and the noises were all in his throbbing, ginger heid! Currently making his way back home from the scene of Scotland’s greatest humiliation yet, Shortbread will be devouring the fitba news from home and unsurprised to learn that, while his country’s football team cannot be relied upon, some things in the world of fitba never change. The talk of Sunday’s Old Firm derby centred around the shock dismissal of the Scottish Premiership’s famously mild-mannered top scorer Alfredo Morelos, sent off for the fifth time this season, when he chomped down on the bait proffered by the famously subtle goading of renowned wind-up merchant Scott Brown and petulantly lashed out. Of course, in the interests of balance it should be noted that one of Alberto’s four previous red cards was in fact downgraded to an orangey-yellow on appeal, although The Fiver can’t quite remember if that was the first one he was shown against Aberdeen, the second he was shown against Aberdeen or the third one he was shown against Aberd … ah here, time’s a wasting and you probably get our drift. On a big day for “Broonie”, Andy Halliday also saw red in the tunnel at full-time following his bad-tempered clash with the Queen’s Celtic skipper, who missed out on the unique hat-trick of having three separate opponents sent off when referee Bobby Madden and his team of officials somehow failed to notice him almost being laid out by a left hook from Ryan Kent. “You’re playing against a player who loves to antagonise,” sighed Pope’s Newc O’Rangers manager $tevie Mbe in his post-match assessment. “Morelos and Kent are both provoked. The guy who antagonised it all from the beginning deserves to be punished as well.” While Mbe failed to elaborate on what punishment should be handed down to somebody for simply being more streetwise than his opponents, being unsporting in victory and having a slightly annoying smirk, Brown is likely to escape punishment on this occasion because Scottish fitba officialdom is famously biased in favour of – checks notes – the Queen’s Celtic and because he didn’t actually do anything wrong. Finally, as a footnote for the benefit of Shortbread and anyone else who might have missed it, during all this violence a football match broke out and the Queen’s Celtic won 2-1.

"What's the next Game of Thrones? All the contenders for fantasy TV's crown Rand al’Thor was found as a baby on the slopes of Dragonmount and taken to Two Rivers, where he grew into a broad-shouldered shepherd boy. But Rand is possessed of immense power, a power as yet untapped, for he is also The Dragon Reborn, destined to be hunted by Darkhounds and Darkfriends as he bids to prove himself a mighty warrior leader. Among other things, Rand’s existence shows that you should always believe ancient prophesies, that even the low-born can save the world – and that characters in TV fantasy series must always have two names. Rand is just one of the 2,782 characters who appear in Wheel of Time, the bestselling saga of fantasy novels by Robert Jordan. We can only hope the forthcoming adaptation on Amazon will hone the cast down a little, as we follow Rand and his forces towards Tarmon Gai’don, or the final battle between good and evil. We’re going to see a lot of Rand and his like over the next few years, thanks to the all-slaying success of Game of Thrones, which returns for its final series this month and then is no more. TV executives, aware for some time that the enormous appetite for fantasy series will not disappear after the Iron Throne has seated its final backside, have been raiding the bookshelves for weighty tomes to take on. With Netflix adapting The Witcher, the cult series by Andrzej Sapkowski about supernatural monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia, and Amazon making big-budget plans for a new take on JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, the years ahead are going to be dominated by a genre previously belittled, mocked or ignored. “Game of Thrones didn’t just open the door to more fantasy commissions,” says US TV critic Maureen Ryan. “It opened the floodgates. I honestly believe that the two biggest things to happen to TV in the last decade were the runaway successes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. It told TV executives not just to pursue fantasy books or comics – but to gobble them up.” The gobbling shows no sign of stopping. In addition to Witcher, Netflix has signed a deal with CS Lewis’s estate for The Chronicles of Narnia, and is also adaptating Leigh Bardugo’s Grishaverse novels whose hero, in an inversion of the standard fantasy trope, is a heroine. Her coming-of-age journey is not as straightforward as it initially seems, though she does of course have two names: Alina Starkov and the somewhat grander Sun Summoner. US channel Showtime is working with Lionsgate on both a film adaptation and a TV spinoff of Patrick Rothfuss’s acclaimed Kingkiller Chronicle, which also subverts fantasy tropes, showing the protagonist not as a shining hero but as a guilty and broken man. On board as producer is Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of musical phenomenon Hamilton. Meanwhile, in one of the few original projects in development, Joss Whedon will return to TV with The Nevers, a slice of Victorian sci-fi to air on HBO. We have HBO to thank for something that sounds genuinely groundbreaking: it has optioned Nnedi Okorafor’s Who Fears Death, which is set in a beautifully drawn post-apocalyptic Sudan and follows Onyesonwu, a child born of rape, on her quest for revenge against her sorcerer father. HBO, keen to keep the goose laying its golden eggs, will also begin filming Long Night, the Game of Thrones prequel, this summer, with Naomi Watts heading the cast and a script by Jane Goldman, co-writer of 2010’s glorious superhero riot Kick-Ass. Into this crowded arena comes the BBC with its ambitious take on Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials due to air later this year. A recent trailer, showing glimpses of everyone from spirited heroine Lyra to glamorous villain Mrs Coulter, all but broke the internet. And spring will see the long-awaited arrival on Amazon of Good Omens, Neil Gaiman’s adaptation of his and Terry Pratchett’s much-loved novel about an angel and demon who join forces to try to save the world. The book’s subtitle is: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch. “Where Game of Thrones has changed things,” says Gaiman, “is not so much in the acceptance of fantasy as in the acceptance of budget. When the idea of making Good Omens first came up, I knew I didn’t want to make the cheap kid brother to Game of Thrones. Amazon understood that and were supportive. The game-changer isn’t really the fantasy bit so much as the idea that you can make TV at that budget and it can be a serviceable business model.” Gaiman, whose cult novel American Gods was also adapted by Amazon, feels this change in attitudes to fantasy is as much generational as it is driven by Game of Thrones. “The thing that has fascinated me most is that, all through the 90s and early 2000s, people would tell me fantasy doesn’t sell. I would tell them that wasn’t true because the top 20 movies even then were all fantasy and sci-fi. They’d spend a lot of time telling me why they didn’t count. Now when I go in for meetings, the people running the studios grew up on fantasy. They’re not embarrassed about that and they’re happy to put what they love on screen.” If Game of Thrones has taught us anything, it’s that what a significant number of viewers love is stories of madness and magic set in a world of high stakes and low morals. Filled with dragons and demons, yes, but also with fully realised worlds, strong characterisation and, most importantly, witty scripts. Cameron Roach is head of drama for Sky, which recently had a word-of-mouth hit with Deborah Harkness’s A Discovery of Witches, about a historian-witch who makes an uneasy alliance with a suave vampire. “Where once people might have been dismissive of this genre,” says Roach, “what we’re seeing is that, increasingly, there are no rules as to what you should or shouldn’t commission.” Roach stresses that striking the right tone is important, mentioning Britannia, playwright Jez Butterworth’s psychedelic take on early British history that saw a pointy-toothed McKenzie Crook playing the sort of druid you’d run a mile from. “[Britannia] has a unique voice,” says Roach, “and there are people who absolutely respond to that, who love the more fantastical elements. A lot of people didn’t come to Game of Thrones until the third series. We’re seeing TV companies making a long-term commitment to shows because they know they can grow their audiences. We’re interested in content that will still be being consumed in five to 10 years’ time. Fantasy is an important component of that.” Not everyone is convinced that simply raiding the fantasy shelves will guarantee a dragon-sized hit. Among them is Adam Whitehead, who runs sci-fi and fantasy blog The Wertzone. “After the success of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films,” he says, “it was assumed we’d get lots of hit epic fantasy movies. Instead we got a bunch of bombs.” He singles out two: flat-footed dragon saga Eragon, and The Golden Compass, which asquashed every bit of wonder out of Pullman’s tale. “There were only a couple of so-so successes, such as the Narnia movies, before the genre lost its shine and cinema moved on to superheroes and dystopian YA. The question here will be if Game of Thrones was a one-off success or if it has sparked a wider audience interest in fantasy TV.” While it’s true that the number of fantasy shows being commissioned is increasing, their quality remains at best mixed. For every Discovery of Witches, there is a Shannara Chronicles, MTV’s lacklustre take on Terry Brooks’ much-loved swords and sorcery saga, or The Bastard Executioner, an ultra-violent tale of medieval mayhem that had the blood and gore of Game of Thrones but none of its character development and wit. “It’s not enough to have swords, mystical elements and dozens of burly men with unkempt beards,” says critic Ryan. “It’s worth remembering that HBO didn’t just want to put a fantasy drama on the air – it wanted to put a good fantasy on air. It spent years of development on Game of Thrones, filming, recasting, reshooting and tweaking, making it as good as it could be well before it premiered. There’s something of a land-grab mentality right now on TV, a feeling that people are just flinging something out there to stay in the game.” Could this apply to Lord of the Rings, rumoured to have cost Amazon $250m (£190m) for a five-series deal? Season one, which reportedly has a bigger budget than the original film’s, remains shrouded in secrecy. Studio head Jennifer Salke recently outlined just how secretive, telling the Hollywood Reporter: “There’s a fantastic writers’ room working under lock and key. You have to go through clearance, and they have all their windows taped closed. There’s a security guard that sits outside and you have to have a fingerprint to get in.” Ryan, for one, remains unimpressed. “It’s not encouraging that Amazon threw that much money at the project before the creative team was put in place,” she says. “It’s putting the cart before the hobbit-sized horse. The whole project faces additional scrutiny because the Peter Jackson films are so damn good. Maybe the team will do a fantastic job. I truly hope so. If they’ve turned it into a bad TV show, millions will be disappointed.” TV creators must do more than simply be faithful to the source material, says Jane Tranter, head of Bad Wolf Productions, makers of both His Dark Materials and A Discovery of Witches. “You have to remember that, rightly or wrong, TV audiences are much bigger than book audiences. For me, the biggest takeaway from Game of Thrones’ success is the way it highlighted how important world-building is – and how much audiences get from that when you get that world right.” Arguably, the shows that will become hits in world after Game of Thrones will be those least like George RR Martin’s juggernaut. Good Omens has a unique sense of humour and looks set to benefit from Gaiman’s close involvement and some top-notch casting including David Tennant and Michael Sheen, which could prove an inspired pairing. Gaiman talks about how important it was to stay true not only to his vision but to that of the late Terry Pratchett: “I don’t know if I would have been as obsessive about getting it right if it had been completely mine.” Meanwhile, Adam Whitehead singles out Wheel of Time as a show that could go global. “The fanbase is already there and the TV creators are taking an interesting and slightly idiosyncratic approach.” Tranter believes that the shows with the best chance of success will be those that offer hope in bleak times. “Post-Game of Thrones,” she says, “the last thing I’d want to do is make an adult male-skewed fantasy with a very full-on attitude towards violence and sex. The great thing about His Dark Materials is that it’s a fantasy that’s very accessible and romantic, that’s open to children and has a positive, optimistic message to send the world. Those are the sort of shows that will resonate right now.” • Game of Thrones returns to Sky Atlantic and Now TV on 15 April. Good Omens will air on Amazon Prime Video on 31 May and on BBC Two later in the year.",Television & radio
"Jason Roy’s hopes of playing in Ashes for England hit by hamstring injury Jason Roy’s hopes of being part of England’s Ashes squad this summer have been hit by a hamstring injury that means the earliest he is likely to play any red-ball cricket is the Test against Ireland in July, a little over a week before battle commences with Australia. Roy has been spoken of as a potential Test opener for England, given his sparkling form at one-day level and in light of Keaton Jennings’s struggles. Alec Stewart, Roy’s director of cricket at Surrey, firmly believes the 28‑year‑old can make the transition to the longer form of the game but admitted on Monday that he faces a race against time to be fit for the Ashes. “Jason is unlikely to be fit for the Essex game [Surrey’s opening fixture of the new Championship season, on 11 April] with this [hamstring] problem. We’re hoping he is but it’s unlikely,” Stewart said. “His first red‑ball innings could therefore be against Ireland in a Test match, assuming he has a good World Cup.” England face Ireland at Lord’s on 24 July in what will be their only post-World Cup five-day game prior to the first Test against Australia at Edgbaston on 1 August. “Jason is opening in one-day international cricket,” Stewart said. “Twenty20 and Test cricket are miles apart but in the first 10 or 15 overs of 50-over cricket you still have to respect that new ball. I don’t see it as a big issue for him and he’d cope with the stepping stone up to Test cricket.” Speaking about his desire and determination to be part of England’s Test side, Roy said: “I just want to play to prove it to myself really. To see where I’m at and to see if I can actually do it. You never know what is going to happen but I just want to put the right stepping stones in and make sure that I’m selected. That is the first process.” Sam Curran claims hat-trick in IPL victory Sam Curran claimed a hat-trick as he took four wickets in just five balls to help Kings XI Punjab to a remarkable victory over the Delhi Capitals.

Delhi looked to be heading for a comfortable victory in Mohali when, chasing 167, they reached 144 for three with 21 balls remaining – but lost seven wickets for eight runs to finish 152 all out.

"Turns out posh boys are better bullshitters. That explains a lot If you’ve ever wondered why the most overconfident embarrassments in the headlines and in your life are so frequently young, posh and male, wonder no more. It’s a thing. Bullshit can be packaged in so many ways, but it frequently comes in a certain form. According to a new study from University College London, young men who come from advantaged backgrounds are more likely to be bullshitters. That is, they believe they’re smarter, stronger and all-round better than they actually are. If you’re balking at the results from Prof John Jerrim and Nikki Shure’s survey of 40,000 15-year-olds, just chew on the details. “We found that male participants were much more likely to bullshit about their knowledge,” says Jerrim. Shure adds: “Unsurprisingly, they are also more likely to believe they are popular at school.” Look back through your life and recall how many people you’ve known like this who have actually been called on their bullshit and forced to reflect and grow from it, how rare that it is. Because when bullshitting doesn’t result in, say, Billy McFarland’s Fyre festival, it can pay off big time. Self-belief, no matter how misapplied and misjudged, is a major part of success. It’s what gets you to the dance, they say, even when you’ve got a shitty moonwalk. Low self-worth can get you stuck outside in the cold. Impostor syndrome, the warped mirror-image of bullshitting, affects two-thirds of working women in the UK. This negative self-sabotage also affects men, but there are reasons why women still make up such a small percentage of politicians, business leaders and world influencers. It’s not all to do with low confidence, of course, considering for example the socioeconomic imbalance and patriarchal structures we’re up against. But believing you don’t have what it takes to change that doesn’t help. If you’re one of those with a continuous nagging doubt in your abilities and every win comes with “you were lucky” self-admonishment, seeing bullshitters succeed is a torment. I once knew someone from the young-posh-male mould – who I’ll call Hal, because he had the sociopathic drone of the computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I was trapped working with him for way … too … long. He sold himself as someone who could turn companies around with his knowledge of the market and business acumen. What he actually had was a mediocre work history mitigated by the arrogance that comes from a safety net of rich parents and an Eton education. Basically, he would be considered a real catch for the majority of modern workplaces, because this is how the world works. If someone presents themselves convincingly as A Big Deal, many will automatically believe them. Hal’s directions often made no sense, his attitude was condescending and cruel, and the breath that wafted from his on-trend hipster beard smelt like eggs Benedict gone bad. But the conviction he spoke with – that was irresistible. He could sniff out insecurity like a truffle-hunting pig, and play with it until hard-working and worthwhile colleagues cried in meetings or started to disassociate at their desk. He’d smirk, while we doubted ourselves. Hal truly believed he was impressive – he was so full of delusion that he didn’t even think he needed a regular oral hygiene routine. Women who can block out those little “you can’t do that” thoughts can get far in a global workplace that too often values confidence over proven skill and results. Elizabeth Holmes did it for a while with the Theranos scam. Miley Cyrus is still out there doing … whatever she’s doing now. But this society is still quicker to reward the young, rich and male. And if you live in a world so quick to forgive, support, and trust you, is it so surprising that you grow up with a head so full of bullshit? • Phoebe-Jane Boyd is a content editor",Opinion
"Elon Musk: entrepreneur, investor … rapper? Name: Elon Musk, the rapper. Age: Two days, according to SoundCloud. Appearance: Auto-Tuned and emphatically uncool. Let me guess – this is just the latest weird pastime from Elon Musk, the entrepreneur. Exactly. And Musk certainly knows how to enjoy himself. Like the time he wondered aloud about taking his electric car company Tesla private, then got into trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission? I was thinking of the time he pretended to start a new tunnel company on a whim. Then actually did start it, with the name the Boring Company. Then promoted it with a sale of novelty flamethrowers. And what is it this time? He has released a novelty pop song about a dead gorilla called RIP Harambe. I admit I didn’t see that coming. Musk delights in wrong-footing people. RIP Harambe is very Auto-Tuned, so it’s hard to tell who is singing, but it seems he made it in collaboration with BloodPop, Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek. I don’t know who any of those people are. It doesn’t matter. The song has already been listened to more than 800,000 times since its release on Saturday. And who is Harambe again? He was a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla. He lived at Cincinnati Zoo and became world-famous in 2016. How come? A three-year-old boy got into Harambe’s enclosure, so the zoo authorities shot the gorilla. Since then, Harambe’s undeserved but probably necessary death has become a standard joke on the internet. Why would you joke about that? It’s awful. Exactly. Some people got so upset about Harambe that being upset about Harambe became a kind of cliche. Now others compete to mourn him more sincerely, more intensely, than anybody else. Is that what the Musk song does? That’s right. It imagines Harambe in paradise, smoking weed and “sipping on some Bombay”, which is a popular gin brand among rappers. “We miss you,” the voice sings. “We really, really miss you.” All right. It’s quite a good joke to actually do it. Musk released it under a new “record label” called Emo G. Emoji? Geddit? That’s not so good. He disagrees. “This might be my finest work,” he said. I thought Musk was supposed to be grappling with electric car production? And building spaceships to go to Mars? And reinventing transportation with vacuum tubes? And spending time with celebrity girlfriends and ex-girlfriends such as Grimes and Amber Heard? And smoking pot on podcasts? He did that once. Whatever. The point is, does the future of humanity really depend on one man’s midlife crisis? Well, he wouldn’t put it that way. “Some people use their hair to express themselves, I use Twitter,” Musk said on Monday. Do say: “Elon, just a suggestion, but how about a holiday?” Don’t say: “How many more zoo animals must die for one billionaire’s amusement?”",Technology
"EasyJet issues Brexit warning, as crisis turns UK into 'laughing stock' - as it happened Time for a quick recap: Low-cost airline easyJet has warned that Brexit uncertainty is hurting its business. EasyJet told shareholders that pricing pressures are building, as potential passengers are unwilling to risk booking a holiday in the current climate. CEO Johan Lundgren pinned the blame on the non-stop flurry of Brexit news (little of it positive!): “We had hoped for clarity around Brexit at this point of time and that hasn’t happened and that clearly has had an impact on customer demand. “Whenever people turn on the television or they are looking up news and they go on to websites, they see uncertainty and lot of bad news. There is a waiting pattern for customers.” The news sent a shiver through the markets, knocking shares in airlines and holiday operators. Here’s the current damage: EasyJet: Down 7% TUI: down 3.8% Wizz Air: Down 6.7% IAG: Down 1.5% The boss of Siemens’ UK operations has also waded in, warning that the Brexit crisis has turned Britain into a laughing stock. Jürgen Maier argued that MPs must back a customs union with the EU (something that will be on the table in tonight’s indicative votes in the Commons) “Enough is enough. We are all running out of patience. Make a decision and unite around a customs union compromise that delivers economic security and stability.” On the economic side, we’ve had mixed reports from the world’s manufacturers. Britain’s factory growth has accelerated, thanks to strong demand to stockpile parts and components ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit. The eurozone is struggling, though, with its manufacturing PMI hitting a near six-year low. German and Italian factories suffered the most. America, though, is continuing to outperform Europe: On the other hand... a rival survey of US factory growth, from the Institute of Supply Management, paints a stronger picture than Markit’s survey. The ISM manufacturing PMI has risen to 55.3, up from 54.2, implying growth remains solid. Newsflash: America’s factory sector also slowed last month, according to Markit’s monthly healthcheck. Manufacturing bosses reported that output growth, and new orders, both slowed. Perhaps significantly, new export orders barely rose, with some firms blaming “global trade tensions” and tariffs for dampening foreign client demand. This pulled the US manufacturing PMI down to 52.4 for March, down from 53 in February, closer to the 50-point mark which shows stagnation. Uh oh.... Shares in ride-sharing service Lyft are being pummelled in early New York trading. They’ve plunged by 10%, sending the stock sliding below the $72 level at which it floated on Friday. The initial pop, to $85, clearly hadn’t lasted long.... Canada’s manufacturers stumbled last month..... with the weakest growth in two and a half years. Data firm Markit says exports fell sharply -- echoing the message from Brazil a few minutes ago. Wall Street has opened higher, boosted by hopes that China’s economy had turned a corner. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 192 points at the open, or 0.75%, with the broader S&amp;P 500 rising by 0.7%. Back to the economic data...and Brazil’s factory growth has weakened a little. Brazilian manufacturers reported that exports sales fell for the fourth month running, suggesting that the global slowdown has hurt the BRIC economy. But domestic demand remained solid, keeping the PMI solidly in growth territory (at 52.8 for March, down from February’s 53.4). The impact of Brexit uncertainty goes beyond summer holidays, of course. Business Over the weekend, the Centre for European Reform calculate that Britain’s economy is 2.5% smaller than it would be if voters had chosen to Remain in the EU in 2016 (this is based on comparisons with other countries’ growth). This, CER estimate, has led to an extra £19bn of borrowing per year -- or £360m per week (close to a certain pre-referendum claim...) Goldman Sachs has also crunched the numbers, and come to a similar conclusion - as the FT explains: The investment bank said that Brexit has cost Britain about 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a hypothetical “Doppelgänger” economy that did not withstand a Brexit shock. Its estimates suggest that the UK economy has underperformed other advanced economies since mid-2016 as a result. Sven Jari Stehn, Goldman economist in London, said the “output losses have been concentrated in investment and private consumption”. “The outsized impact on investment suggests that political uncertainty associated with the Brexit process may, indeed, be one of the major sources of the economic cost of Brexit,” he said. EasyJet’s CEO, Johan Lundgren, has blamed the torrent of Brexit news for scaring customers away from booking flights. Speaking to reporters this morning, Lundgren said potential passengers were stuck in a virtual ‘holding pattern’, reluctant to commit to a holiday until they know more about Britain’s future. Explaining today’s gloomy trading update, Lundgren says: “We had hoped for clarity around Brexit at this point of time and that hasn’t happened and that clearly has had an impact on customer demand. “Whenever people turn on the television or they are looking up news and they go on to websites, they see uncertainty and lot of bad news. There is a waiting pattern for customers.” Newsflash: Two former Barclays bankers have been jailed after being convicted of conspiring to manipulate global Euribor interest rates. Carlo Palombo, formerly Barclays vice president of euro rates, was sentenced to five years imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court today. Colin Bermingham, a former Barclays managing director, received four years. Both men were found guilty last week after a retrial. They were accused of conspiring to rig the benchmark rate for borrowing between commercial banks, which is used to set the rates on global financial contracts and loans. A third defendant, Sisse Bohart, was acquitted. Lisa Osofsky, Director of the Serious Fraud Office, says: “These men deliberately undermined the integrity of the financial system for personal gain and to advantage the banks they worked for. “We are committed to bringing those who defraud others to justice, regardless of how long ago the offences took place.” Oil is also rising this morning -- boosted by the news overnight that China’s factories returned to growth last month. Brent crude has gained one dollar per barrel to $68.68, its highest level of 2019, as traders anticipate higher demand. That’s another blow to airlines, as it will push their transport costs higher (unless they’re hedged against fuel costs). Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University points out that the pound usually suffers when Brexit worries start rising... and here’s the proof: He explains: Daily movements of the sterling rate follow developments in UK policy uncertainty (as measured by discussion of policy uncertainty in 11 UK newspapers) very closely. There is a clear negative impact of policy uncertainty on the sterling rate (correlation =-0.40). What is also interesting is that policy uncertainty drops and sterling picks up immediately after the meaningful votes of the 15th of January and the 12th of March on the ground that there will always be another attempt by Mrs May to push her deal over the line. Sterling is also rising slightly today on the ground that tonight’s vote(s) will provide a possible solution for the way forward. If, instead, the voting process is inconclusive, uncertainty will spike and sterling will record a free fall. Hopes that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided are pushing the pound up this morning. Sterling has just nudged $1.31, which means it’s clawed back a cent since Theresa May lost the latest vote on her Withdrawal Deal on Friday. MPs will hold further indicative votes later today, and there’s speculation that plans for a softer Brexit could win more support. However, this would surely split May’s cabinet, with many ministers arguing that crashing out without a deal would be better. Europe’s stock markets are shaking off the deepening gloom in the eurozone’s manufacturing sector. The main indices are all positive, led by Germany’s DAX which has gained 1.2%. At first glance that’s quite remarkable, given German factories just suffered their sharpest contraction in almost seven years (see here). But... it appears that stronger Chinese factory data overnight is driving investors to snap up shares in German manufacturers. They’re wagering that the recent slump in global growth may have bottomed out. So industrial giant Thyssenkrupp are up 4%, with car typer maker Continental up 3.8%. Auto firms such as Daimler (+3.5%) and VW (+2.8%) are also gaining. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says: Stock index futures gapped higher overnight, while copper prices and risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar also rose in response to the latest Chinese data, which pointed to a surprise rebound in activity at the world’s second largest economy. The positivity has carried forward to Europe where the markets were sharply higher at the time of writing, despite the release of some mixed-bag data here. Here’s our news story on the split between British factories (slogging away stockpiling), and their eurozone rivals (weakening month by month). City experts have been pondering easyJet’s warning that Brexit uncertainty is hurting its business, and pushing down prices. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says investors are afraid that other airlines are also struggling. “EasyJet’s warning about softer ticket prices has sent shockwaves across the airline industry, adding to problems already voiced by tour operators and suggesting that 2019 could be a washout for the travel sector. “People have been worried about the impact of Brexit on the aviation sector and there is lots of chatter that individuals are holding off from booking flights and holidays. “If you’re going to hand over a large sum of money for a trip abroad, you want to be reassured that the flight will actually happen and will take off as scheduled. At the moment travellers don’t seem to have that reassurance. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says people are resisting booking flights until they have more certainty about Brexit’s impact on travel regulations and currency rates. The group reckons demand will pick up later in the year, but a more pragmatic observer would say it’s difficult to put a timeframe on when Westminster and the EU 27 will solve the Brexit puzzle. This uncertainty means easyJet requires some blue sky thinking just now. Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, thinks easyJet is still a good investment (especially as shares are 7% cheaper this morning!): While the lowering of expectations for the second half is a negative for investors, it should be noted the CEO also pointed out recent government measures means it will be flying as usual after Brexit whatever the outcome. While there was always likely to be some turbulence in the run-up to Brexit, the company’s relatively strong balance sheet and opportunities for growth in Germany alongside a healthy dividend mean we continue to recommend the shares as a ‘buy’ for investors willing to accept a medium level of risk.” The surge in Brexit stockpiling really is unprecedented -- suggesting that UK warehouses are packed tightly with supplies ahead of supply disruption. Newsflash: Brexit uncertainty is driving demand at UK factories, who did much better than their eurozone rivals last month. Data firm Markit has just reported that UK manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 13 months in March. It says UK companies stepped up production to build-up inventories in advance of Brexit. They also benefitted from a surge in new orders from clients who have been scrambling to stockpile goods. Many factories hired more staff to tackle this demand -- a boost for the labour market. But it’s not all good news... companies also reported longer delays to get raw materials and components, as the rush to stockpile goods puts pressure on supply chains. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says: “Manufacturers reported a surge of business activity in March as companies stepped-up their preparations for potential Brexit-related disruptions. Output, employment and new orders all rose at increased rates as manufacturers and their clients raced to build safety stocks. Stocking of finished goods and input inventories surged to new survey-record highs. “The stock-building boost introduces a major headwind for demand, output and jobs growth moving forward. Manufacturers are already reporting concerns that future trends could be constrained as inventory positions across the economy are unwound. The survey is also picking up signs that EU companies are switching away from sourcing inputs from UK firms as Brexit approaches. It looks as if the impact of Brexit preparations, and any missed opportunities and investments during this sustained period of uncertainty, will reverberate through the manufacturing sector for some time to come.” The eurozone’s manufacturing sector is in its steepest downturn since the height of the region’s debt crisis in 2012, warns Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: He says today’s weak PMI report suggests the euro economy could keep weakening in 2019: New orders are falling at a rate not seen since 2012, and disappointing sales mean warehouses are filling with unsold stock. The orders-to-inventory ratio – a key indicator of the future production trend – is at its lowest for almost seven years. Expectations of output for the coming year are also the gloomiest since 2012. “Concerns over trade wars, tariffs, rising political uncertainty, Brexit and – perhaps most importantly – deteriorating forecasts for the economic environment both at home and in export markets, were widely reported to have dampened business activity and confidence. Newsflash: Eurozone factories just suffered their sharpest contraction in six years. Data firm Markit has reported that manufacturing operating conditions in the eurozone deteriorated sharply in March, at the fastest rate since 2013. Factory bosses reported that new orders shrank, forcing them to cut production and badly hurting business confidence. Europe’s biggest member, Germany, had a particularly grim month, Markit says: The overall downturn was led by Germany, where operating conditions deteriorated to the greatest degree in over six-and-a- half years. Italy fared little better, with its PMI at a near six-year low. This pulled the overall eurozone manufacturing PMI down to 47.5 -- any reading below 50 shows that the sector shrank. This reinforces concerns that the eurozone economy has stalled in recent months, hurt by the slowdown in the global economy (and the US-China trade war). The UK chief of German manufacturing group Siemens also has a timely warning for UK politicians -- Brexit is turning Britain into a laughing stock. In an open letter published on Politico, Juergen Maier warned that the political rows and deadlock over Brexit is wrecking the UK’s reputation for business stability. He warns: The U.K. Office for National Statistics on Friday confirmed investment is in its worst slump since the last recession, and we already know 80 percent of businesses say Brexit has damaged investment decisions. Worse, the damage this is doing to the country’s hard-won reputation as a serious and stable place to do business is now all too real. The world is watching, and where the U.K. used to be beacon for stability, we are now becoming a laughing stock. I personally can no longer defend the action of our parliament when reporting to my managing board, making it hard to win support for finely balanced investment decisions that in the end have an impact on U.K. jobs, innovation and the competitiveness of our activities here. A no-deal Brexit would be “hugely damaging”, Maier adds, pleading with MPs to reach a consensus and back a customs union with the EU. “Enough is enough. We are all running out of patience. Make a decision and unite around a customs union compromise that delivers economic security and stability.” EasyJet’s warning is actually good news for passengers. Given consumer uncertainty, airlines will struggle to put prices up this year. Something to bear in mind when booking your summer holidays, as Karen Tso of CNBC tweets: Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo explains (via Reuters) why easyJet’s statement has worried the City: “The outlook is the challenge, with management having less confidence on the second half - the summer.” “Brexit uncertainty is the main issue, but management sees macro uncertainty beyond the UK too.” EasyJet is the worst-performing stock on the FTSE 100 this morning. Other airlines are also suffering from its warning. IAG (which owns British Airways) are down 2%. Wizz Air has lost 1.5%, while Ryanair fell 5% at the open. Ouch! EasyJet’s shares have slumped by 6% at the start of trading in London. Investors aren’t impressed by its warning that Brexit is creating “increased softness” in ticket prices. Shares have shed 68p to £10.49, the lowest level since mid-December. Some snap reaction to easyJet’s statement, from investment manager Robert Barron. Here’s the BBC’s Clodagh Rice: EasyJet has also been hit by higher oil costs in recent months, and by currency moves, saying: It is expected that easyJet’s unit fuel bill for the six months to 31 March 2019 will be around £37 million adverse, while headline foreign exchange will have an adverse impact of around £8 million Budget airline EasyJet has fired a warning that the Brexit crisis is hurting its business, and spooking potential customers from buying flights. EasyJet told shareholders this morning that it is now more cautious about its prospects for the next six months, due to “increasing softness” in prices. It singled out the many ‘unanswered questions’ about Britain’s departure from the European Union as a key factor. It’s a timely warning, as MPs prepare to hold another round of indicative votes on Brexit, amid swirling speculation that Britain could face another general election. Johan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, warns the City: “For the second half we are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit which are together driving weaker customer demand. EasyJet expects to have made a £275m loss for the last six months, so could do without Brexit confusion clouding the crucial Easter and summer holiday season. More encouragingly, easyJet says it’s “well-prepared” for Brexit, whatever the outcome. Now that the EU Parliament has passed its air connectivity legislation and together with the UK’s confirmation that it will reciprocate, means that whatever happens, we’ll be flying as usual. I am pleased that we have also made progress on our European ownership position which is now above 49%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Happy April! A new month means a new flurry of economic data, showing how the world’s factories sector fared in March. These Purchasing Managers Index reports (PMIs), from IHS Markit, are expected to show that eurozone manufacturing contracted in March, while the UK slowed (but kept growing). David Madden of CMC Markets points out that Germany is struggling. Italian, France, German and UK manufacturing PMI reports will be in focus this morning, and traders will be paying close attention to the German report seeing as the flash reading was 44.7 – its lowest since July 2012. Weak readings could fuel concerns over Europe’s economy; conversely, traders will be hoping to see signs of green shoots. Overnight, China’s factory PMI has beaten expectations, with manufacturing bosses more upbeat about growth and output.

"Brexit protester who disrupted Eurostar admits nuisance charge The Brexit protester who disrupted services on the Eurostar last week by standing on top of St Pancras station in London has admitted a charge at Westminster magistrates court of causing a public nuisance. Terry Maher, 44, from Camden, north London, climbed on to the roof of the station at 7pm on Friday and remained there until 8am on Saturday. He waved a St George’s flag and told arresting officers he was angry at politicians for “fucking up Brexit”. Maher’s actions took place on the day the UK was supposed to leave the European Union and caused the cancellation of eight Eurostar services and major delays for thousands of passengers. Southeastern also cancelled 16 services on the high-speed rail line, and delayed many more. Robert Simpson, prosecuting, said: “The defendant managed to gain access to the roof of the building and he told the police at the time he had a Stanley knife. “There was a total of 1,757 minutes of lost time as a result and the estimation is that there will be in excess of £40,000 in delay fines.” The disruption caused delays for 7,000 to 8,000 passengers, Simpson said. Maher told police he had “thought he was going to need bolt-cutters” to get on to the building and went on to say he disliked politicians, saying they were “fucking up Brexit”. He also made comments about migrants in the country and complained about foreign aid money spent in India. Maher, who was remanded in custody, will appear at Blackfriars crown court on 29 April over a second count under the Malicious Damage Act. The district judge, Richard Blake, said the protest was “very serious indeed” and warned others against similar action. “I hope a wider audience at large reflects on the gravity of these offences before they might be encouraged to follow your behaviour,” he said. He told Maher: “People must understand that even when issues of great national concern are in the public domain, and we live in a free society where they can express their views, that if they resort to manners of protest which cause widespread public disruption, which you did, I should think untold members of the public had their weekends spoiled. “It cost many thousands of pounds.”",Politics
"The careers advice every two-year-old needs Oh God, have we left it too late? The career chat with the kids, as in: “Guys, of course you must do whatever you want when you grow up, and the main thing is that you’re happy, but have you thought about being ... say, a doctor? Doctors make people better, and that makes doctors happy (and doctors’ daddies are happy, too, which isn’t important, but if you do want to make Daddy happy …).” A report, entitled More Than a Job’s Worth: Making Careers Education Age-Appropriate, for the charity Founders4School, says that children as young as two should be introduced to careers education, with the aim of broadening horizons and challenging stereotypes. I have a couple of children, boys, recently turned seven and five; now I’m in a panic that we’ve let them down by not providing those early rungs on the career ladder. What were we doing when they were two? Can we turn back the clock, three years and five years … No, let’s not play with cars today (because they all just went to the charity shop). Lego? OK, but why don’t we make a ... hospital? Great idea, and this room is called the operating theatre, and this really cool man is called the surgeon. Look how happy he is! And you, other child, you can make a Lego courthouse. This excellent dude here is called a lawyer. I think he might be even happier than the doctor – he’s probably got a yacht. Would you like a yacht when you grow up? Actually, it might not be too late. The thinktank LKMco, which carried out the research for the report, talks about primary-school-aged children as well as two-year-olds. Some primary schools have already got “job corners” in their classrooms, where information and stories about different professions are available, along with props and costumes. So, when I drop off tomorrow, I’ll be checking all four corners of two classrooms very carefully. Nope, not interested in their artworks, definitely not interested in the newspapers they have been making. (Newspapers? Are they having a laugh?) And if there’s nothing career-related there, we’ll just have to make our own job corner at home, with props and costumes and everything. Go ahead and try it on, we’ve got them in blue and green, they’re called scrubs. This is a scalpel (maybe don’t take it to school). And for you, check out this brilliant ... wig.",Education
"Superdry's co-founder and chief to clash in battle over chain's future A co-founder of Superdry and its chief executive will face off in a shareholder vote on the future of the fashion retailer, which has lost its “cool” and 65% of its market value over the past year. Julian Dunkerton, the chain’s multimillionaire founder, is seeking shareholders’ backing to reinstall him on the board of the company he quit last year in a row over strategy. Dunkerton, who owns 18% of Superdry, has vowed to restore the brand to its former glory and turn around the “catastrophic” decline in its share price. However, Superdry’s board, led by the chief executive, Euan Sutherland, are urging shareholders to reject Dunkerton’s plan, claiming his return would be “extremely damaging”. They say Dunkerton is to blame for the company’s loss of direction and poor design choices, as he was brand director until he stood down last March. The directors have threatened to quit en masse if Dunkerton returns. The showdown will come at a shareholders’ meeting at Investec investment bank in the City of London on Tuesday morning. Dunkerton has said: “I’m confident we’ll win.” The collapse in the share price has cost him more than £150m since he left. A second Dunkerton-proposed motion calls for the appointment of Peter Williams, a former Selfridges executive and Boohoo chair, to the board as a non-executive director. Dunkerton’s plans have the backing of the Superdry co-founder James Holder, who owns 10% of the shares and has called for an “urgent sea change” in the company’s direction. Two of the Superdry’s key institutional shareholders – Investec and Schroders, which together control about 10% – also appear to be in his corner. Added together that gives Dunkerton’s 38% of the vote; more than 50% of which is required to pass the motion. Superdry’s management has been publicly backed by Aberdeen Standard Investments, which has about 10% of the shares, and the proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Pirc, whose views guide passive investment funds. Glass Lewis, the proxy advisory service, said although Superdry’s financial delivery had been “very poor in recent months, at least part of the responsibility for this underperformance appears to lie with Mr Dunkerton”.",Business
"Man on trial for murder of victim who died 11 years after attack A construction worker who was jailed 11 years ago for attacking an ex-soldier has gone on trial for murder after his victim died of epilepsy. Neil Sutherland, 35, is charged with murdering Paul Mills by battering him with a baseball bat. He has already served a four-year jail sentence for the assault. A jury heard on Monday that in 2006 the pair got into an argument over the sale of the metal bat in a layby before Sutherland, 22 at the time, repeatedly struck Mills to the head. Mills suffered catastrophic head injuries including a fractured skull and brain damage as well as post-traumatic epilepsy, which meant he suffered uncontrollable regular seizures, the court heard. In 2017, 11 years after the attack and seven years after Sutherland was released from jail, 44-year-old Mills was found dead at his home near Warminster, Wiltshire, face-down in the bathroom. Sutherland was charged with murder and the prosecutor, William Mousley QC, said the epileptic fit that caused Mills’s death was a direct result of the “extremely violent” attack more than a decade previously. A pathologist who examined his body has said there was an “unbroken link” between the death and the assault, the jury heard. Mousley told the court that Sutherland, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, attacked Mills on 28 July 2008. The QC said: “Mr Mills was unarmed and Sutherland intended to cause him really serious harm and he did so – namely a fractured skull and brain damage. Sutherland was prosecuted and pleaded guilty, but Mr Mills developed epilepsy from the injuries. “He had his first seizure not long after being taken to hospital and from that day on there were regular seizures for 11 years, despite treatment and medication. “At the beginning of March in 2017 Mr Mills was found dead at home alone, having suffered an epileptic fit. His death was a result of what happened to him in 2006.” He added: “Sutherland admitted his guilt in 2006 but now Mr Mills has died he says he has done nothing wrong. He said he was trying to defend himself and that the fatal injuries were not his fault. “He blames his father, who is now deceased and unable to deny it, for making him plead guilty [in 2006].” Mousley told Salisbury crown court that Mills was left in a coma after the attack. He was cared for by his mother for a year after he was released from hospital. The barrister said Mills briefly served in the army before being dismissed for joyriding and his last years had led a “generally happy life” away from trouble and had become a grandfather. James Newton-Price QC, defending, said Sutherland was a “man of low intelligence” and had a “mild learning disability”, although this is disputed by the prosecution. Sutherland denies murder. The trial continues.",UK news
"Chaman Lal Chaman obituary My friend Chaman Lal Chaman, who has died aged 85, was a television and radio presenter whose face and voice were well known to the Punjabi-speaking community in the UK. He was also a poet and published two collections of poetry in Punjabi. Born in the village of Partapura, near Jalandhar, in eastern Punjab, before the partition of India, to Harbans Lal Pun, a clerk, and his wife, Hanso Devi (nee Sirpal), he attended Anglo Sanskrit high school in Rurka. In 1952, he sailed to Nairobi, Kenya, to join his father, who had gone there to make a better life, and began working in the post office. In 1959 Chaman got a job as a full-time radio and TV presenter and newsreader for the Voice of Kenya, the national broadcaster. By 1971 he was its head of radio operations, covering programmes in 14 languages including English, Kiswahili, Punjabi and Hindustani. He took a keen interest in the cultural activities of the Asian community in the country, in particular music, dance, poetry and plays at the Kenya National Theatre. In the 1950s the Indian community in East Africa, mainly of Sikhs, Muslims, and Hindus from undivided Punjab, lived a harmonious life with a total population of 177,000. Chaman, a Hindu Punjabi, was introduced to a circle of poets and political activists by my father, Gopal Singh, a Sikh communist trade unionist and photographer. Chaman joined the group, reading poetry at public functions including religious events in Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu mandirs (both places of worship) and Muslim community venues. In 1974 Chaman moved to London and worked for the BBC World Service (Hindi and Urdu), BBC One’s Asian Magazine, Radio 4’s Make Yourself at Home and on LBC. For a while he also worked with EMI (London) in charge of its Asian music repertoire. He was ethnic arts adviser in the London borough of Hounslow from 1990 until 000. After retiring in 2000, he worked with two popular Punjabi community radio stations, Sunrise, based in Southall, and Panjab Radio in Hayes. Some of Chaman’s poems were set to music and recorded by the singer and composer Jagjit Singh and his wife, the singer Chitra Singh. Some of these songs appeared in films, becoming hits in India: Balle Balle (Bravo Bravo) in Bride and Prejudice (2004), directed by Gurinder Chadha, and Maula in Vaada (2005), directed by Satish Kaushik. Chaman donated his sound recordings to the British Library in 2005, including rare interviews with Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian prime minister, just after the Chinese attack on India in 1962; with the actors Sunil Dutt, Pran, Raj Kumar and Dilip Kumar; and with the tabla maestro Alla Rakha. Chaman is survived by his wife, Pushpa (nee Madār), whom he married in 1957, and two sons, a daughter and five grandchildren.",Television & radio
"Dear Robert Smith – spare a thought for us poor interviewers My how we laughed at Robert Smith’s reaction when the Cure were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Deadpan, he responds to giddy, over-eager interviewer Carrie Keagan, who, bubbling with gleeful enthusiasm, asks him: “Are you are as excited as I am?” Glumly, he replies: “By the sounds of it, no.” When I wrote about music, my life was frequently complicated by interviewees who could or would not cooperate. The interview process is seldom sparkling, but we do what we can with occasionally fatigued, overwhelmed, intoxicated, arrogant, tedious musicians (some are lovely, admittedly). A friend attempted to liven up his days on the interview circuit treadmill by posing questions cut from random magazines (including gardening publications) to the initial bewilderment, then eventual amusement, of his subjects. I still have fond memories of interviewing Edsel Auctioneer for the NME, a Leeds band with the nous to tell benign lies in order to enliven the process (who offered a welcome, slightly ribald fib about song lyrics and a Jacuzzi). Bands might imagine that all journalists are super-keen devotees, paid to spend weeks extensively researching the object of their adoration, when my reality was a features editor noticing a space to fill, their eyes alighting on the nearest likely writer. This explains why, as a huge Triffids fan, I was tasked by a post-lunch, well-refreshed features editor with chatting to the McComb brother who had not contributed to the Johnny Cash tribute album we were reviewing (he was generous and tolerant but couldn’t throw me a lifeline; the interview was abandoned). I once interviewed a brand new Manchester band whose guitarist wept, explaining that he’d never been asked questions by anyone before. However, Rick Astley at the height of his fame appeared tired, bored and therefore quite dull, reasonable, it must be said, when he is just some bloke who can sing after all. And not all interviews could be as thrilling as my phone call with Wendy James of Transvision Vamp, who after the first hello suddenly began to scream loudly accompanied by the sound of fire extinguishers down the line, having dropped a match and apparently set fire to her clothes. Or Linda Womack, who (probably jet-lagged) repeatedly hung up. Interviews can be a chore for all concerned, it is true. Jason Lytle from Grandaddy asked tetchily if my tape recorder was working, having been subjected to an hour of tech failure before my chat with him (he was lovely after that). Back in the day I interviewed Peel favourites Stump (I was assigned all the greats) who admitted to being asked virtually the same questions by battalions of neophyte fanzine writers for days on end. A musician friend regularly tweets during mammoth mid-tour interview fests: “How’s the tour going?” since he might be asked that same question every 20 minutes for several days. Tracey Thorn’s reaction to that Robert Smith moment on Twitter was insightful, noting that a woman behaving in a similarly arsey fashion would probably be instantly derided as a morose diva. Would Smith prefer interviewers to be casually dismissive or nonchalant? He’s lucky to be honoured. In future, perhaps try to be nice about it. • Penny Anderson is a writer and artist",Opinion
"Is Turkish poll shock the beginning of the end for Erdoğan? Recep Tayyip Erdoğan turned Turkey’s local elections into a referendum on his personal leadership. The results, showing his Justice and Development party (AKP) in retreat nationally and losing control of seven of Turkey’s 12 main cities, not counting Istanbul, will thus be viewed as a stinging personal repudiation. The question now is, how will Erdoğan react? The man who has dominated Turkish politics since 2003 is a bad loser, unaccustomed to defeat. He cannot abide criticism in any form – and despite his claims to the contrary, the big swing against the AKP, on a 84.5% countrywide turnout, amounts to an unprecedented rebuke. Erdoğan certainly deserves blame. As is his wont, he alone ultimately directed the AKP’s campaign. Discarding any pretence of impartiality, he exploited his position as president and held almost daily rallies for two months preceding the vote. He said an AKP victory was a “matter of national survival” and claimed his opponents were in league with terrorists. Even by his unscrupulous standards, he hit an all-time low by screening video footage of last month’s Christchurch mosque killings at rallies, saying the attacks were part of an organised western campaign against Muslims in general, and Turks in particular. The poll outcome is Turkey’s biggest political shock since the failed 2016 coup attempt. Erdoğan’s immediate reaction then was to order mass arrests and blame foreign-based plotters, including the US military. He went on to use the coup as an excuse for launching indiscriminate nationwide purges to strengthen his grip on power. Similar payback can now be anticipated, although probably not on the same scale. As in the past, the AKP will launch legal challenges against winning opponents with the help of a pliant judiciary, seeking to disqualify them before they can take office or contesting the propriety of local electoral procedures. Erdoğan will be especially determined to quash celebrations in Kurdish areas of south-east Turkey, where the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP) made gains. He maintains the HDP is in cahoots with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party. The HDP adamantly denies this. Several pre-poll arrests of HDP activists on terrorism charges were reported. The fate of the HDP’s most charismatic leader, Selahattin Demirtaş, is instructive. He gave Erdoğan a run for his money in national elections in 2014 and was consequently marked down as a threat. Demirtaş has been held in jail since 2016, accused of disseminating “terrorist propaganda” among other things. The European court of human rights’ demand for his release has been ignored. Having won sweeping executive powers in a stage-managed referendum last year, Erdoğan’s domination of Turkish institutions, including the government, military, and courts, is already formidable. The ability of independent journalists to scrutinise and investigate has been all but crushed – which many link to a perceived increase in corruption. If anything, Erdoğan will now further tighten his grip. All of which makes the performance of the main opposition party, the Republican People’s party (CHP), in winning Ankara and other cities, all the more remarkable. The party’s veteran leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, has survived endless AKP ridicule and intimidation. He has now gained a measure of revenge. The CHP’s successes will boost all the opposition parties and renew hope that democracy in Turkey, almost given up for dead last year, may yet be disinterred. Is this the beginning of the end for Erdoğan? It is too soon to say. He does not face a national election until 2023. He has proved his staying power again and again, and his base support, mainly rural, remains strong at about 44%. But there is one wild card beyond his control: the state of the economy – a determining factor in the weekend polls. Erdoğan’s untutored efforts to block interest rate rises, boost prestige infrastructure spending and ignore rising debt levels have helped propel Turkey into recession, exacerbating currency, inflation and unemployment problems. Rocketing food prices, and shortages of household staples, spell trouble for any politician, anywhere – even a grand Turkish sultan. The price of onions may yet be Erdoğan’s undoing.",World news
"Bangladesh could take over workplace safety despite 'shocking unreadiness' Bangladesh’s government could assume responsibility for safety in workplaces producing clothing for major western brands this week despite demonstrating a “shocking level of unreadiness” to do so, according to an analysis of the state’s own data. The country’s supreme court is scheduled to decide on Sunday whether to kick out the Bangladesh accord on building and fire safety, an international initiative to remove life-threatening hazards from factories that was put in place after the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in which more 1,100 people died. The accord has overseen improvements including the installation of fire doors, sprinkler systems and the upgrading of electric wiring in 1,688 factories that produce clothing for brands such as H&amp;M, Esprit and Primark. The Bangladesh government has been responsible for improving safety in about 745 other factories. Bangladesh’s labour ministry and garment factory owners argue the $29bn industry has become much safer in the six years since the disaster and that its inspectors are ready to take over the accord’s work. But the government’s performance in the 745 factories under its control illustrate otherwise, according to an analysis by a consortium of labour rights organisations seen by the Guardian, which will be published on Tuesday. Not a single garment factory under the government’s control has completely eliminated all the “high-risk” safety hazards in their buildings, according to the report. Outstanding issues include buildings with lockable emergency exits, a danger that is required to be fixed within two weeks of being identified. Bangladesh’s urgent need to improve building safety has been reinforced in past months by a series of deadly fires, including a six-hour inferno in an upmarket office block in Dhaka last week that killed at least 25 people – some of whom were hampered from escaping because of locked emergency exits. The analysis, using safety progress data last updated by the Bangladesh government in January, found the vast majority of the 400 factories for which data is available had completed less than 20% of their required renovations. In contrast, factories covered by the accord had completed 89% of their upgrades. In addition, more than 50 factories identified by the accord as too dangerous to continue making clothing were found to still be operating under the government’s inspection programme, the report said, with no evidence they had carried out any safety improvements. The report’s authors, who include the Clean Clothes campaign and the Workers Rights Consortium, said that ejecting the accord from Bangladesh “would put workers’ lives in danger”. “Many lives have been senselessly lost to factory disasters in the past decade,” they said. “It is unconscionable for the government to rush the transfer of responsibilities of the one safety programme that has brought substantial progress.” The Bangladesh government has been contacted for a response to the findings. Factory owners and the government are eager to see the accord leave, arguing that their industry is being more heavily scrutinised than those of their low-cost competitors in China, Vietnam and Ethiopia. Many of the safety upgrades are expensive, and the government offers little financial assistance. More broadly, industry leaders argue they have been investing in safety while facing unrelenting pressure from western buyers to make clothes more cheaply. The import price paid by EU buyers for clothing has fallen from about $1,589 (£1,212) per 100kg in 2012 to $1,520 (£1,160) last year, according to data provided by a factory owner. Rubana Huq, whose Mohammadi Group is one of the country’s largest manufacturers, said the time had come for the country to retake control of its industry. “The process has begun,” she said. “So far prescriptions have prevailed. But now, it’s time for self-monitoring, which is the ultimate and collective goal of the buyers, vendors, labour reps and all the other stakeholders.” The accord’s original five-year term expired last year and its attempt to continue operating an office in Bangladesh until 2021 was challenged by the country’s supreme court last year. After six adjournments, it is scheduled to rule on the challenge on Sunday. Several major western brands have expressed their concern to the government that the premature closure of the accord’s office could risk the safety improvements that have been made so far as well as spark activism that would muddy their image at home. If the accord loses the case, it would have to continue monitoring factories by pairing with international engineering firms to send inspectors in and out of the country, significantly slowing and limiting the scope of their work. It could also be prevented from identifying any new safety problems. Deaths in Bangladesh’s garment sector have fallen in the past five years since the accord was introduced from about 71 a year to 17, according to research from New York University’s Stern Centre.",Global development
"Re-Textured festival review – perfect dive into the pitch-black underground When it comes to music festivals where you drink cans of cider in the pouring rain, the UK shows the world how it’s done. But a certain kind of event, popular in continental Europe, has been lacking here: the experimental club-cultural festival like Berlin’s CTM or Krakow’s Unsound where beats pound arrhythmically, the phrase “modular synthesis” is spoken confidently, and anyone not wearing black is presumably kept outside in a holding pen to be given a change of clothes. The debut of Re-Textured goes a long way to redress this, situating an ambitious series of shows amid brutalist buildings – the minimal techno of architecture – across a long weekend in the capital. At 180 The Strand, Danish artist Puce Mary keeps galloping glam rock drums from falling into a groove, before stalking the stagefront on the mic amid an anxiety attack of techno-leaning noise and trouser-vibrating bass. The tough techno of Mancunian duo Demdike Stare shows how confidently they’ve stridden to the heart of the dancefloor from its fringes, and Michael England pairs them with a gawping but humanist series of images: Blackpool punks, vogue dancers, Times Square tourists. But the night’s standout is Lee Gamble. Accompanied by exuberant high-gloss visuals, he daubs impressionistic streaks of rave across the crowd – a jungle break here, a hardcore synth run there – to poetically condense a 12-hour bender into less than an hour. A bloke offers me half of his Twix: “Energyyyy!” In Village Underground, Lucrecia Dalt plays a riveting set, where Laurie Anderson-style warped balladry morphs into dub techno skanking, complete with Timmy Thomas-style congas. Jan Jelinek chooses to show his forbidding, er, modular synthesis setup on a big screen as he manipulates it – an interesting, nerd-enrapturing decision that destroys the magic of what he’s doing, but also enhances it somehow. As he shifts from hauntological bursts of psych-pop to fiendishly intricate analogue melodies, he seems to be communing with a spirit world via his machine, Ouija-style. At Walthamstow Assembly Hall, Jasss taps into the en vogue fascination with ultra-rugged breakbeat techno, her power growing with her intensity. This uncouth, lo-fi sound is sent to a Swiss finishing school by the artist who follows her, Alva Noto: still pounding and swinging, but now with a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer. His kick drums are exquisitely designed, like darts of hard air, and there is a kind of Bond-villainish evil to the malevolent craft of it all. Andy Stott loosens the night’s collar again – this peak-time set means he doesn’t get to show his strongest, slower work, but the brilliantly chaotic flurries of junglism have a group of lads shouting “Order!” à la John Bercow. Despite his dub techno pedigree, Moritz von Oswald keeps the energy levels up, even allowing a disco-house line to sass its way into his DJ set. Closing on a high out in Docklands on Sunday are Caterina Barbieri, who taps into the melodramatic grandeur of trance with her serious, reverent synth chorales, and Shackleton, whose use of cantering Afro-Cuban percussion and marimba remains inimitably his. With nine other events not mentioned here, including techno heavyweights such as Nina Kraviz and Blawan, longtime party promoters Krankbrother deliver a knockout: a smoothly run, smartly curated new festival that draws lines between head and feet – in, of course, pitch-black.",Music
"A climate for change: how the Educators' Challenge is addressing real-world issues An ocean liner that takes young people from islands most affected by climate change to educate others about environmental degradation; the African Leadership University, which has launched a degree in global challenges; and the Social Presencing Theatre where participants become aware of three bodies: their own, the social body, and the Earth. What do these very different projects have in common? They are all finalists in the Global Challenges Foundation’s Educators’ Challenge. The Global Challenges Foundation (GCF) was set up by Swedish philanthropist Laszlo Szombatfalvy in 2012 to mitigate the catastrophic global risks that face humanity today. These risks include climate change, pandemics and weapons of mass destruction. One of the ways GCF has done this is through creating the New Shape Prize, where participants put forward projects to improve global governance and tackle worldwide threats. But while some people are only too aware of these problems, getting the world at large – particularly young people – to become interested and involved with solutions to these issues is another matter. GCF has addressed this through the Educators’ Challenge, which was specifically designed to tackle the lack of awareness and engagement on global governance. This competition asked for innovative approaches that would involve students and broader audiences in discussions on the importance and principles of global governance, its history and its potential future. According to Victoria Wariaro, project leader of the Educators’ Challenge: “Today, as a global collective, we are faced with interlinked and highly complex challenges that transcend national borders. Everyone should have the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the high levels of risk that we face, and the key elements of how global governance can mitigate those risks. This needs to be communicated effectively to increase engagement.” In November 2017, the GCF put out an open call for all types of creative educators – from teachers and lecturers to PR professionals and games developers – to come up with ideas to spread the discussion on global governance. By June 2018, when the entry period ended, more than 70 entries from all over the world had been received. “For the first time, we can see there is a huge community of people really engaged with these issues,” says Wariaro. Now, a diverse final jury of seven members will select 10 winners who will receive prizes of $5,000 at the Educators’ Challenge awards in May. Prizes will be awarded for the most effective and creative proposals, and there will also be a People’s Choice award. From 1 April, visitors to the Educators’ Challenge website will be able to look at the videos produced by finalists and vote for the project they like the best. Simply doing this will help spread understanding and promote discussion about global governance. Another of the finalists in the Educators’ Challenge is a multiplayer online game called New Shores – a Game for Democracy, whose lead developer is Aleksandra Solińska-Nowak from the Centre for Systems Solutions (CRS) based in Poland. “[The game’s] goal is to help young people realise how difficult it is to reconcile conflicting needs and develop a well-functioning community,” she says. In New Shores, players imagine they have moved to an island in the middle of the ocean and need to develop a thriving society. This is easy at the start: they have plentiful resources, which they are able to keep or invest in public institutions, education and so on. In the course of playing, the resources start to shrink. This means the players have to collaborate. They also have to find effective solutions to poverty and homelessness, and save the world from disaster. “It is an internet game, but the social element is really important,” says Solińska-Nowak. As a result, there is a real-world narrator (such as a teacher) running the game and facilitating discussion afterwards. Unlike most online games, it is not clear how you win or lose. “The most common comment from young people is that this is like the real world,” she adds. “You have to identify your own goals: do you invest for private profit or act for the common good?” So why did CRS enter this game into the Educators’ Challenge? “We were looking at a way to promote [the game] among educators,” she says. The game had already been developed and was available for use. “But being free is not enough. We have to make people notice it,” she stresses. Jakob Rhyner is professor of global change and systemic risks at the Innovation Campus, Bonn, and a member of the Educators’ Challenge jury. “Engaging more people in the challenges we face today is the alpha and the omega in trying to implement sustainable development goals,” he says. The projects are all very different from each other, and overall diversity was something the jury looked for in drawing up the shortlist. “I hope these different projects can get together and cross-fertilise,” stresses Rhyner. “This is the most useful thing they can do. There is more wisdom out there than we can imagine. We must collect it and support it.” The Educators’ Challenge awards, co-organised by LSE Institute of Global Affairs, will take place on Wednesday 15 May in London, UK. The educational day will explore how to increase engagement and awareness around global catastrophic risks. Apart from the awards ceremony, the event will feature panel discussions and keynote addresses by influencers and experts invited to share their knowledge and insights.

"Liverpool just won’t stay down – they’ve become Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of GOATs, it was the epoch of frauds, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, they had everything before them, they had nothing before them, they were all going direct to Heaven, they were all going direct the other way. It was a period in which the only degree of comparison was the superlative and nobody could feel pressure without being denounced as a bottler. Liverpool were not bottling the title after 89 minutes at Anfield on Sunday but nor can it reasonably be denied that what happened in the second half, as Tottenham came back at them after a disjointed first half, was conditioned to a large extent by circumstance and the awareness of everybody present of the significance of the result. Had Liverpool dropped points, had Manchester City remained top on goal difference with a game in hand, then City could have afforded to drop points. As it is, any slip – and City have to play Spurs at home and Manchester United away – could hand the title to Liverpool who continue, somehow, exhaustingly and implausibly, to find a way to win. What happened in those frantic final minutes against Spurs was absurd. Jürgen Klopp effectively risked everything on one final double substitution, bringing on Divock Origi and Fabinho for Jordan Henderson and James Milner. The shape became 4-2-4, although in the circumstances shape seems a slightly misleading term: it was effectively Virgil van Dijk in one half and everybody else up the other end. It could have cost Liverpool the title. Had Van Dijk, closing down the passing route to Son Heung-min while forcing Moussa Sissoko on to his weaker left foot, not stifled a two-on-one counter, the sort of break that only comes late as one side desperately chase a goal, Spurs would probably have won and given City clear water. Klopp would then have been condemned for casting caution to the wind for going too gung ho but it worked. The final, critical, chance did fall their way and, via an error and a fortunate ricochet, so did the winner. Every time it looks like they are finished, every time it seems City can begin to relax, Liverpool jerk back into contention with a chilling gasp; they have become Glenn Close in the bath in Fatal Attraction. In the scrabble for scapegoats after Brazil had lost to Uruguay in the final game of the 1950 World Cup, the crowd did not escape blame. “When the players needed the Maracanã the most, the Maracanã was silent,” the musician Chico Buarque said. “You can’t entrust yourself to a football stadium.” But that was what Klopp did. In cold tactical terms his substitution made little sense; emotionally it was precisely what Anfield needed. Klopp threw forwards on the pitch and had faith that the occasion, desire, need, will, whatever, would do the rest. Liverpool have started using the phrase “this means more” in their branding this season, prompting (largely justifiable) eye-rolling from fans of other clubs sceptical of the myth of Scouse exceptionalism. There has been a theory the desperation to end a 29-year run without a title has led to an unhelpful mood of anxiety around Anfield. The nervous energy that surrounds Liverpool these days is undeniable, the edge sharpened perhaps by a sense, so formidable does the structure at City appear, that this opportunity may not come again any time soon. On Sunday, though, it worked for Liverpool: amid the frenzy it was Tottenham who made the mistake. In the days when close title races were common, this was what happened. Players, managers and crowds tighten up as the line draws closer; in 2012 City and Manchester United staggered their way to the epic conclusion. It feels there is something in the culture of the modern game – perhaps the gulf between the best and the rest, perhaps the way players seem to exist on another plane both of wealth and ability, perhaps the obsession with analysis, perhaps familiarity with Fifa and Pro Evo – which denies that. It demands the protagonists should remain bundles of data unaffected by emotion. But tension is natural, overcoming it is part of the game. For spectators it’s part of the fun. The modern world of extremes, though, seems to struggle to acknowledge that, desperate to apply the tag of bottler to anybody who is struck in the moment by a sense of what a shot or a tackle or a save might mean. After the dip of the early part of this year, Klopp seems to have found a way to channel that. Liverpool keep coming up with late winners, keep inducing mistakes from opponents. That sort of thing can provoke a story of destiny, can become self-perpetuating, inspiring a team to a final push while inducing in their opponents a debilitating insecurity. Perhaps it is written, perhaps Liverpool can ride this emotional wave. But equally it should not be forgotten that in Fatal Attraction Glenn Close ended up getting shot. Nobody can keep coming back forever.",Football
"UK frontline troop numbers down by as much as a third Personnel numbers in some frontline British army units are down by as much as a third, figures show, prompting serious concerns about their readiness for action. The government was accused of “appalling complacency” over recruitment after the publication of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) data, which showed a number of battalions with hundreds fewer troops than their requirements state. While publicly available government figures show an overall deficit of 8%, the new data showed a much larger deficit in infantry groups on the frontline. Information published in response to a parliamentary question by the MP Mark Francois revealed that the Scots Guards, 1st Battalion, only had 460 personnel in October last year, 34% below its 697 workforce requirement. The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, 2nd Battalion, had 330 people, 31% below its target strength. The Welsh Guards, 1st Battalion, and the Mercian Regiment, 2nd Battalion, had only 72% of their target strength, while the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, 1st Battalion, had only 74%. Twelve of the 30 infantry battalions included in the data were missing more than one in five of their required personnel, while only three met or exceeded their requirement. Dr Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said the figures were worrying, pointing out that Russian ground forces already had much higher numbers of infantry in equivalent units. “You need three times as many men as the enemy when attacking,” he said. “A battalion that is missing 10% of its strength can probably compensate for the shortfall. Having lost 30%, you are not going to be able to generate the combat power to stand up to two enemy battalions, even in the defence.” The British army is on course to miss its targets for the number of recruits it should have by 2020. The army’s 2020 strategy, published in 2015, aimed to have 82,000 army personnel and 30,100 reserves by March 2019. According to MoD statistics, the army only had 79,790 trained personnel in October 2018, and 26,960 trained reserves. In 2012, the MoD signed a decade-long contract with the outsourcing company Capita to manage recruitment to the armed forces. The National Audit Office found in December that Capita had consistently missed the army’s targets, with the shortfall ranging from 21% to 45% each year. Responding to the figures, Francois, the Conservative MP for Rayleigh and Wickford and a member of the defence select committee, said: “These numbers make starkly apparent what ministers have been seeking to hide for some time, which is that the frontline strength of the regular army is now being seriously eroded by the lack of recruits to refresh infantry battalions, because of the calamity that is the Capita recruitment contract. “This has gone beyond the simple criticism of an ineffective contractor: this now directly affects the defence of the realm. These people are so incompetent that they are now impacting our national security and ministers should sack them without hesitation.” In the summer of 2017, Francois published a report into army recruitment, in which he also attributed the fall in recruits to low unemployment, an ageing population, the increase in people taking up post-16 education and the ending of the deployment to Afghanistan in 2014. Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, said: “Ministers are guilty of appalling complacency as personnel numbers fall month after month. There is now nothing short of a crisis in recruitment and retention to the army. The decision to outsource recruitment to a private company, Capita, has been a total failure. It is high time to scrap that bad deal and bring the service back in house.” Watling said the MoD should shorten the bureaucratic process for signing up recruits. “Enough people apply to join, but far too many drop out,” he said. “The MoD also needs to strengthen their offering to enlisted soldiers. We don’t see the same retention problems among officers. Every man who leaves takes their training and experience with them, so we need to improve retention.” An army spokesperson said it was meeting all its operational commitments to keep the country safe. “The ‘workforce requirement’ is not the minimum threshold the army needs to fulfil its operational requirements, it represents the number of positions in each battalion,” they said. “We are fully committed to improving our recruiting process, and working with Capita, we have put in place a plan to address the challenges.”",UK news
"Air pollution falling in London but millions still exposed Two million people in London are living with illegal air pollution, according to the most recent data. However, nitrogen dioxide levels are falling and could reach legal levels within six years. In 2017, London saw its first breach of annual pollution limits just five days into the new year and in 2018 it occurred within a month. However, three months into 2019, no such breaches have taken place. In 2016, the last year in which Boris Johnson was mayor of London, there had been 43 breaches by this time. The new data is an update of the London Atmospheric Emission Inventory, which now includes 2016, the latest year available. It shows 2 million people living in areas with toxic air, including 400,000 children. It also shows that between 2013 and 2016, total nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions fell by 9%. However, over the same period, the number of primary schools in illegally polluted areas barely changed, going from 371 to 369, while the number of secondary schools affected grew from 81 to 86, according to City Hall. Sadiq Khan, who has been mayor of London since May 2016, has moved the cleanest buses to the most polluted routes and introduced a charge for highly polluting vehicles that enter the city centre. This is being toughened from 8 April with the start of an ultra low emission zone (Ulez) that penalises more diesel cars, the primary source of NO2. “From the very outset I have been crystal clear that I would do everything in my power to tackle London’s toxic air crisis,” said Khan. “The data I’ve published today gives an even clearer picture of the urgent need to take action.” He said the Ulez would be the first in the world to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ministers have been defeated three times in the high court over the inadequacy of their national action plans. The latest plan, described by environmental lawyers as “pitiful”, revealed that air pollution was much worse than previously believed. Air pollution causes at least 40,000 early deaths in the UK from lung and heart disease, but it is being linked to an increasing range of health impacts, from miscarriage to teenage psychosis. “London needs effective measures to improve air quality to an acceptable level at which it is not having a negative influence on children’s health,” said Prof Frank Kelly at King’s College London. “I applaud the mayor and his team for taking the bold action needed to protect the health of London’s children.” A recent KCL study looking at the rate of reduction in NO2 levels across London found that the trend between 2010 and 2016 under Johnson meant it would have taken 193 years to reach legal levels. Further KCL modelling indicates the new policies mean this time period has been reduced to just six years.",Environment
"How a hippy upbringing inspired this entrepreneur's food-sharing app “Most people are surprised to learn that half of all food waste occurs in the home, compared to less than 5% at the retail level,” says Saasha Celestial-One, the US born co-founder of British food-sharing app, Olio. “The average family throws away £800 of food each year that could’ve been eaten. Collectively that adds up to £15bn per year. “Adding insult to injury, we have 8.4 million people living in food poverty in the UK.” Celestial-One and her business partner Tessa Clarke started Olio in 2015, and it has grown from a local initiative in north London to a company with a presence in 46 countries and more than 900,000 users. The premise is simple: users snap a picture of their food items that would otherwise go to waste, and add them to Olio. Neighbours then receive customised alerts and can request anything that takes their fancy. Pick-up is arranged via private messaging within the app. According to Olio, 50% of all food listings added to the app are requested in less than two hours. Celestial-One and Clarke met during their MBAs at Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2002. Both grew up in farming families: Clarke, a farmer’s daughter, saw a third of her family’s work discarded daily, and had the idea for Olio when moving back to the UK from Switzerland and was unable to find anyone to give her surplus food to. Celestial-One was raised in rural Iowa as the eldest of six siblings by what she calls “hippy entrepreneurs”. Her second name – Celestial-One – is her legal name, and was made up by her parents, who drummed into their children not to let things go to waste from a very early age. “My mother had to be incredibly resourceful in order to make ends meet, and I have memories of accompanying her on scavenging missions around town. We’d go to homes that were being torn down, and collect wood, toilet fixtures – anything of value that could be used again or sold on.” Right before she was born, her parents started their own company selling bulk herbs and spices to their friends and families. Eventually that company would become successful, but for the first half of her childhood she says she “felt poor”, with new clothing or toys the very rare exception. She eventually headed to business school before a 13-year career working at global corporations such as Morgan Stanley, McKinsey and American Express. But she was now a world away from her hippy roots – it distressed her mother so much she cried when she got her first job at an investment bank. And then, in 2005, Celestial-One’s boyfriend at the time was accepted to Cambridge. The couple decided to move to the UK together. Neither Clarke nor Celestial-One have a background in mobile app tech. “We’ve been lucky to find experts in tech who believe in our mission who have helped us to build the apps,” Celestial-One explains, “and we also have an exceptional in-house team of developers, too. They started the company with £40k pooled from their life savings. “What makes Olio work is the growing community of users, volunteers, and more than 300 businesses that donate food each week.” In December, Olio received the climate action award at the UN climate change conference in Poland, in recognition of its potential at scale to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The app’s growing success has been accompanied by a change in social attitudes, she continues. “Since we started Olio there has been a tangible shift with regard to public and political awareness of the unsustainable problem of food waste. “Plastic has also been very much in the spotlight, and the message that small actions can lead to big change seems to be resonating with consumers more, as people look to lead more sustainable lifestyles.” However, critics argue that a simple app can’t do much about a problem of such scale. The issue of food waste is truly gargantuan and getting worse all the time, with 66 tonnes thrown away every second and predicted to increase by a third by 2030. Household food waste is one thing, but there is also considerable wastage in food manufacturing and the hospitality sector. It’s estimated that each year in the UK 1 billion plates of food are wasted across its restaurants, pubs, hotels and quick service eateries. Also, by its nature – needing a good number of users to work, and requiring them to be able to travel easily to each other – Olio is limited to cities, although Celestial-One says it’s starting to take off in smaller towns. But investors remain interested in the project. So far the company has raised £6.25m from angels, venture capitalists and impact investors. And they will be going to market in early 2020 for funding to help further expand outside of the UK. Celestial-One adds: “We have successfully seen 1.2m portions of food shared between neighbours through the Olio app. “Mass consumer behaviour change is possible, and the cynics are usually the ones who reluctantly acknowledge it only in hindsight.” She adds that, unlike with her banking career, her mum is now proud of what she does. “In many ways Olio has helped me to come full circle, back to my roots and the values I was raised with.”",Guardian Careers
"We couldn’t help but wonder: Did Carrie ruin Sex and the City? Teetering in on a pair of Manolo Blahniks, Sex and the City hit the screen with a heady cocktail of sweary friendships, strong looks and saucy hook-ups. It was a feelgood hit, with the window on dating in New York providing glamorous escapism and making stars out of its four strong female characters. Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte gave the world a refreshingly frank and funny look at a new telly breed: smart women who weren’t asking anyone to put a ring on it (unless it was that episode about Miranda getting very intimate with her running partner). Even better, the mere thought of women talking about blowjobs over brunch was enough to set the sexists off. Hell, it was the show that launched a thousand cupcake tours and Cosmopolitan-fuelled women (and men) screeching: “I am Carrie Bradshaw!” SATC came to the screen in a beautiful pre-9/11 New York, where dates were plentiful and a woman could pay her rent by writing one sex column a week in her underwear. This was a time before Tinder, a charming world in which people still hooked up IRL and, if they were Carrie Bradshaw, kept their bras on during sex. Bradshaw was a woman so badass she could walk around New York in a frothy white tutu, banging from man to man and discussing the whole thing with her faithful friends: anything-goes Samantha, uptight Charlotte and I-don’t-have-time-for-this Miranda. Sure, Darren Star’s glossy show took a while to find its expensively clad feet. The first season was punctuated by vox pops from random New Yorkers and didn’t yet get to the nitty gritty of female friendship, but by season two it was set in its shiny groove. Samantha was flirty and forthright without having yet morphed into a cartoon vagina on a stick, and the four friends faced horrific situations (a baby shower) and tricky choices (to threesome or not?). It didn’t matter that it wasn’t realistic. SATC was made in a different age, when you could smoke indoors and no one raised a pre-Botoxed eyebrow at Samantha calling people “trannies” or the fact that every regular character was white. For years it remained a lovable and re-runnable romp. That was until Carrie began to really grate. Although later seasons had plenty to love, from Miranda’s complicated reaction to her mother’s death to the post 9/11 expression of love for New York, viewers [adopt Carrie’s inner voice] couldn’t help but wonder if Bradshaw might be too annoying for TV. Her constant ruining of any non-toxic relationships became tiresome, with the ultimate sabotage of cheating on Aidan with Big. And then there was the money thing. The ditsy I-don’t-know-how-much-cash-I-don’t have move culminated in season four’s low point when Carrie admitted she’d spent $40,000 on shoes and had to get the bus. She was useless, seeing everyone around her like walking Link machines. Carrie’s move to Paris bordered on ridiculous and then the show committed two sins: giving each character a happy-ever-after man and paving the way for those terrible movies.",Television & radio
"Police who shot unarmed man followed procedure, watchdog finds Police who shot an unarmed black man in the chest at point-blank range were following “policy and procedure”, the police watchdog has found. Sharif Cousins, a founder of a youth charity and former gang member, was not charged with any offence after he was shot by firearms officers on 26 July 2017 near his home in Rubery, Birmingham. The 42-year-old told the Guardian he was out buying cigarettes with a friend when he was ambushed by armed police. The bullet entered Cousins’ chest, broke his ribs, punctured his lung and became lodged in his back. He spent nearly a month in hospital, much of it in a coma. Cousins’ friend Jamael Scarlett was arrested at the scene and later convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison on three counts of possessing a firearm and ammunition. In a summary of its report on the case, published on Monday, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said: “No prior intelligence existed which named Sharif Cousins as a subject of, or being of interest to, the police operation.” It said police learned of his identity only when he was taken to hospital. However, the IOPC concluded: “Our thorough investigation examined the actions of all the police involved, including the officer who fired the shot, and we found that they were in line with policy and procedure.” It said officers had been briefed that they might face an armed threat and that gang members involved in gun crime in the region often hid weapons down the back of their trousers. The report summary stated that when the men were stopped and asked to show their hands, Cousins “held his hand slightly behind him and towards the rear of his body” and appeared to be getting something out of his pocket. “Believing the man to have a weapon he was about to use, one of the officers shot the man in the chest,” the report said. The officer said “he did not believe he had had viable alternative options – such as, for instance, Taser – due to the immediacy of the potential threat posed”. The IOPC’s regional director, Derrick Campbell, said: “In our view the officer concerned believed that there was an immediate and genuine risk posed to him and his colleague when he made the split-second decision to shoot.” Cousins was previously a member of the Birmingham gang the Burger Bar Boys, which has been locked in a feud with a group called the Johnson Crew. He has spent a total of 15 years in jail, including eight years for pointing a gun at a police officer’s head. He was released in 2011 and the following year founded New Day Foundation, which received national publicity for its work to deter young people from getting “sucked in” to gang culture. Scarlett was not armed when Cousins was shot, but police said Scarlett had discarded ammunition near Cousins’ house and that the ambush was part of a wider operation that led to six people being jailed for firearms offences. Cousins, a father of four, told the Guardian that the shooting had had a lasting impact on his health and that he was on anti-anxiety and anti-depression medication. His lawyer, Terence Channer, of Scott-Moncrieff &amp; Associates, said he planned to sue West Midlands police for the injury caused to his client. “Clearly he’s received a gunshot wound and our view is that that should not have happened,” Channer said. “A highly skilled, highly trained officer is shooting an unarmed civilian. How has that happened? My focus is going to be on getting that video evidence. I want to see what they saw.” Channer said only around 12% of complaints against the police were upheld, so the IOPC findings had not deterred them. “It is not a judicial finding. It is not binding in a court of law,” he said. Cousins claims he was harassed by the force in the years leading up to his shooting, and arrested by armed police a number of times, but only ever charged for driving offences and resisting arrest. West Midlands police confirmed last year that he had been arrested seven times since 2014. Cousins said police obtained a warrant to search his house in the days after his shooting, which he said was evidence they were trying to find an excuse for having shot him. West Midlands police declined to comment. “In my youth I did things that I’m not proud of and I got involved with things that I shouldn’t have done, but I have never once gone unpunished for a crime,” he said on Monday. “Eventually, when I got to my late 20s I realised that this wasn’t a life I should be living any more. I came out of prison and all of that stuff is behind me.” The IOPC was due to publish its investigation last summer, but publication was delayed due to legal arguments over what details could be made public. As a result, only a summary of the report was published on Monday. West Midlands police declined to comment on the IOPC findings.",UK news
"Tears and cheers as Iago Aspas returns to save Celta Vigo again In the end, it all became too much and Iago Aspas broke down and wept, slumped into his seat sobbing. One by one, his team-mates came to him, putting an arm around his heaving shoulders, taking it in turns to hold him. All around, they sang: 22,315 of them, people just like him, chanting his name. He sat, eyes red, and half-watched the final minutes of a match he had won, lost in his thoughts. Through his tears, football was a better place, more meaningful. Balaídos certainly was, signs of life at last – and this was life. Here was a glimpse of feeling and of salvation, something for Celta de Vigo to hold on to. Him, basically. Hope had returned but it hurt. Saturday was always going to be significant and so was Aspas, but few expected it to end quite like this. In Vigo, they were celebrating the reconquest, when the city rose against Napoleon’s troops in 1809 but it was another reconquest that occupied many of them, and if the old town filled with people in 19th-century costume, carrying swords, guns and axes, bagpipes and drums, the streets around Balaídos filled with light blue shirts, flags and flares, the team bus edging to the ground through the smoke, scarfs swirling. Celta were in the relegation zone, 18th, four points from safety, and were playing 17th-placed Villarreal: opportunity but also obligation. “We have to finish the game dead,” the manager Fran Escribá said. Lose and they pretty much would be. Celta had to win, they knew, but they hadn’t won in six. They hadn’t even scored in four. They had only won once all year, 2019 a nightmare, and the situation was desperate. The fans responded, packing the place, sold-out days in advance and noisier than ever. There was unity, a shared mission. It was now or never and, with perfect timing, hope came in the scrawny, slightly runty figure with the tin chest. In one corner by the club’s offices, someone had placed a life-sized cardboard cut-out of Aspas – 1.75m, 67kg – turning it into a shrine, an altar, a place to plead for divine intervention. The cardboard Aspas wore a Viking hat on his head, Celta scarfs around his neck, and at his feet were candles, garlic cloves, photos, lucky charms, fruit and rosary beads. Which might sound a bit over the top, as if he was their guide, the spiritual reserve of their nation, their God. But, then, he kind of is. It’s not that Iago Aspas is Celta de Vigo’s best player; it is that, as this weekend demonstrated once again, Iago Aspas is Celta de Vigo. He joined them aged eight, lying about his age to get a trial. Hot headed, running up the red cards, he left in a huff as a kid, but was soon back again, suitably apologetic; he left for Liverpool and Sevilla because the club needed the money, but came back again that time too. He is a Celta supporter who plays like one; not so much a footballer as a fan pulled from the stands and stuck in the team. His wildness didn’t always serve him well – he missed one derby through suspension and was sent off in another – and he has changed, calmed a little, but there’s a touch of that still and there’s something in the way that he plays, the desire and the desperation, that is contagious. Necessary, too; it’s not just that he plays well, it is that he makes everyone else play well. No one gets Celta like him, the scout who first spotted him claiming “he even knows where the seagulls shit at Balaídos”, and it is hard to do justice to just how important he is. There may be no single player in Spain as significant for his team. What has happened this season – what happened on Saturday – underlines that, although it goes back even further. Of the 27 games that Celta have played without Aspas in primera while he has been at the club, they have won just five and lost 18; in that time, they have scored three times as many goals with him as without him. Going into the match against Barcelona just before Christmas this season, Celta were ninth, had 21 points and were three points off Europe. Oh, and seven points and nine places above the relegation zone. That day, Aspas got a calf injury. It was 22 December and it was bad but no one expected it to be this bad. He returned for 24 minutes against Getafe, coming on with Celta losing, but wasn’t right. He started warming up to face Levante, but felt something in his calf and had to stop. He sought specialist treatment, white blood cells treated in Barcelona, physio carried out in Madrid. He was desperate to get back and they were desperate to get him back: sometimes for all the analysis, it’s simple; sometimes it’s about a single player. “I’ve suffered so much during all this time, not being able to help,” he said on Saturday. “My family know what I’ve been through.” By then, everyone could see it in his face as he cried. On the pitch, they had seen what Celta had been through too, week by week, defeat by defeat. Coming into this weekend, they’d played 12 games since the day Aspas got injured, and lost 10, winning just once. Celta had picked up 24 points with Aspas and four without him, seeing them pass nine teams on their way down: from ninth, seven points from relegation, they went into Saturday’s meeting with Villarreal 18th, four from safety. Not that it was just numbers. “Aspas transcends the measurable,” insisted El Faro de Vigo, rightly. Now, at last, he was back. Not fully fit, not really ready, but back. And there was belief again, hope that history might repeat itself: on Aspas’s debut in 2009, he scored twice including one in the 94th minute to rescue Celta from relegation to the Second Division B – and, €80m in debt, quite probably from going out of existence. “A kid from ‘home’ rescued the club,” says captain Hugo Mallo. In 2013, top scorer with twice as many goals as anyone else, he led Celta to another astonishing salvation, providing the decisive pass on the final day. “The 4%,” they called it because that was the chance they had as the final weeks approached. Yet somehow they did it. Six years on, it was time to save them all over again. “He’s as important for us as Messi is for Barcelona,” said midfielder Brais Mendez. “He’s not going to be at his best, but he can help,” Escribá said. He couldn’t help much to start with. Celta were a goal down after 11 minutes, two down after quarter of an hour, Alfonso Pedraza turning all Maradona to score the second for Villarreal. By half-time, there was no response. Silence took Balaídos, resignation. Seven points adrift with eight games left, it was over. Only with Aspas it never is, and then it happened. He curled in a superb free-kick just after half-time, belief flooding back. There was no celebrating, just a call to arms, dashing back to the centre circle, game on. Maxi, who’d scored a single goal, none of them from open play without Aspas, headed an equaliser on 70 minutes. And the pitch tilted; Villarreal hung on, Celta kept coming and, with eight minutes left, they got a penalty. The clock showed 82.15 when it was given; it showed 85.04 by the time Aspas put the ball on the spot, all on him. Three minutes to think, seeking his space away from the maddening crowd. Alone, he held the ball. He waited. He did a few kick-ups and waited some more. He watched what was going on around him, listened as Mallo came up and said something: club captain, best friend, member of the Iago Aspas supporters’ club. There was a smile at one point, but it didn’t last long. And then, after three minutes waiting and three months out, three months of pain and defeat, there was a shot at redemption. Ten metres away, Sergio Asenjo did star jumps. Aspas ran up and rolled the ball into the corner, pulling at the Celta badge over his heart as he roared. “Aspas returned to save Celta from hell,” ran the headline in AS. “Aspas’s tears are Celta’s life,” said El Mundo. He was royalty, said Marca: “Aspas the VI of Vigo.” In El Mundo Deportivo, they insisted: “Anything is possible with Aspas on the pitch.” El Faro de Vigo insisted: “Aspas is the best player who ever wore Celta’s shirt and he will never leave: in the future, people will tell their grandchildren about him.” With a minute to go he was withdrawn, his work done – for now. Applauding as he went, tears fighting their way through, in his eyes and theirs, he sat down on the bench and started to sob. Staring down at his feet, pushing his socks to his ankles, he tried to wipe the water from his eyes but it was pointless. One by one his team-mates came to him until the final whistle went. Then, at last, he stood and walked across the pitch, burying his head in his big, black coat, eyes stinging, body trembling beneath it. When he reached the other side, Iago Aspas was asked what he was crying for. “For everything,” he said.",Football
"Sega Mega Drive Mini retro console arrives in September Sega has announced a release date for the long-expected Mega Drive Mini, a modern version of its classic 16bit console. Launching on 19 September, the retro replica will feature 40 built-in games, and comes with two controllers and a HDMI port, which plugs straight into modern televisions. It will cost £70/$80. Following the hugely successful Nintendo NES and SNES mini consoles, as well as the PlayStation Classic, the Mega Drive Mini is designed to resemble a smaller version of the original machine – even including the headphone volume slider from the initial version of the Mega Drive (known as the Genesis in the US), which was removed from the later Mega Drive II iteration. Sega has yet to reveal the full lineup of games, but favourites Sonic the Hedgehog, Ecco the Dolphin, Comix Zone and ToeJam and Earl are among confirmed titles. Arcade legends Altered Beast and Space Harrier II are also there, as well as cult action adventure titles Castlevania: Bloodlines and Gunstar Heroes, and role-playing great, Shining Force. Sega has revealed little information about the technical spec beneath the familiar console casing. At first, it was reported that retro hardware specialist AtGames would be handling the Mega Drive emulation – the company has previously produced a range of Sega console clones. However, fans expressed concerns about the quality of previous AtGames devices, and in September 2018, Sega tweeted that it would be working with an alternative partner to produce the software emulation for the Mega Drive Mini. Nintendo started the current wave of official retro consoles when it launched the Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System in November 2016. That machine sold out almost immediately and was later relaunched, followed by the arrival of the Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Together the two machines have sold more than 10m units. Sony launched its PlayStation Classic last December, offering 30 built-in games, but the product was criticised for the mediocre quality of the software emulation. Sega will no doubt be watching sales of the Mega Drive Mini very closely. The company stopped producing new console hardware in the early 2000s, but has a range of popular machines including the Saturn and the Dreamcast, which could be candidates for similar modernisation. • An earlier version of this article listed Earthworm Jim as one of the 40 games on the Mega Drive Mini console. The Guardian has since discovered this game has been replaced with Toejam and Earl.",Games
"Tory MPs’ no-deal fetish is making a cross-party Brexit solution impossible The number of Conservative MPs who are prepared to take Britain out of the EU with no deal is now greater than the total number of Conservatives elected to parliament in 1997. That is not the only way that British politics has changed since then. Parties have a lot of different positions over 22 years, but the capture of the Tories by no-dealism has happened within 22 months. When Tony Blair’s landslide victory reduced the Tory MPs to a rump of 165, Euroscepticism meant something different. It was all about obstructing Britain’s entry into the single currency, resisting new treaties and grumbling about old ones. Only on the outermost political fringe would anyone advocate shredding the treaties, kicking away the legal and diplomatic foundations of Britain’s partnership with the continent and seeing what happened. Even three years ago, no one in the official leave campaign thought that was a good idea. Now 170 Tory MPs – more than half of the party’s parliamentary cohort – are signed up. That number, which includes many cabinet ministers, is reported to have endorsed a letter urging the prime minister to deliver the UK out of the EU promptly and regardless of the terms. This runaway radicalisation has many causes, of which the most recent is Theresa May’s declaration of intent to stand down before Brexit’s next phase begins. The prospect of a leadership race diverts any party’s focus towards the visceral prejudices of its activist base. In the Conservative context, it generates a dark gravity that pulls everyone away from rational discussion of Britain’s strategic European interests. This does not bode well for the second round of indicative votes on possible Brexit plans in parliament. The theory is that MPs will take control of the agenda and, in a spirit of cross-party compromise, alight on a viable option that can command a Commons majority. But there is a bug in the system. A cross-party majority in parliament still needs a government to enact its choices. The current government, for all its divisions and dysfunctions, is still a Conservative one. May still clutches the seals of office. It would be tricky enough for a Tory administration to do the bidding of a coalition that included dozens of opposition MPs. But the ferocity of anti-Brussels feeling in the Conservative ranks is now so intense that any bloc in favour of softening Brexit is bound to have a Labour majority. This was obvious from the first round of indicative votes. The “common market 2.0” plan that has the Tory MP Nick Boles as one of its sponsors won favour from 188 MPs. But only 36 of them were Conservatives. A more popular option that day was a customs union. That got 265 votes – no majority but not miles away from one. But of that 265, only 33 were Tories. Only eight Tories backed the idea of a confirmatory referendum. Those are paltry contributions to a compromise plan, compared with the 170 who are relaxed about no deal. The indicative votes are not meant to forge lifelong political partnerships. The purpose is finding a platform that at least 320 MPs (the threshold for a working majority) can bear to be on together for long enough to get through the current crisis. It is hard for that project to work if the ruling party cannot supply enough bodies. This is not just a flaw in the indicative votes process. It is an obstacle to the formation of any kind of national unity government – an idea that has been gaining currency in Westminster steadily over the past few weeks. It appeals mostly to moderate Tories appalled by the fanaticism of their colleagues. Sir John Major went public with his support for a grand coalition over the weekend. But when politicians envisage bi-partisan administrations they still have to imagine a prime minister and a cabinet at the top. And since Tory MPs would be furnishing a minority of MPs – perhaps only a third – to vote for the Brexit plan that would be the unity government’s sole purpose, it isn’t obvious why a Tory should get to steer that enterprise from Downing Street. But try suggesting a national unity government under a Labour prime minister – even a figure who is respected by moderate Tories such as Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn – and the idea quickly looks more far-fetched. Since averting the worst of all Brexits became a frantic race against time, the focus has been on agreeing some kind of plan. And as the Commons deadlock has tightened, the ambition has shrunk to winning at least one vote, on one day, by a majority of at least one. In reality, a workable plan means legislation that runs the full gauntlet of amendment and rejection in both chambers of parliament. It needs a majority that can endure for weeks, maybe months. The indicative votes process is a fine symbol of the cross-party spirit in which Brexit might and should have been undertaken. It was obvious after the last election that, in a hung parliament, traditional party allegiances would need to be suspended to get a deal done. Even Julian Smith, the Tory chief whip, now accepts that the Commons arithmetic in 2017 demanded a change of course. But party lines have proved to be one of the stickier bricks in the Jenga tower of conventional habits that passes for a constitution in this country. It is a bit late now to try to pluck them out. And while it might be possible to envisage a majority in this parliament for a sensible Brexit settlement, it is not possible to imagine Tories making up a majority of that majority. That is an immovable problem in this parliament and a reason the whole tower could easily come down. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",Opinion
"Lupita Nyong'o apologises after Us 'evil' voice disability row Lupita Nyong’o has apologised after she was criticised for mentioning Robert F Kennedy Jr and the larynx disorder spasmodic dysphonia as inspirations for her role in horror film Us. Speaking on the View, Nyong’o said: “It’s a very marginal group of people who suffer from this … The thought that I would, in a way, offend them was not my intention. In my mind, I wasn’t interested in vilifying or demonising the condition.” She added: “I crafted Red with love and care. As much as it [was] in a genre-specific world, I really wanted to ground her in something that felt real. For all that, I say sorry to anyone that I may have offended.” Red is the name of one of the characters Nyong’o plays in Us, a doppelganger of the film’s lead character Adelaide. Nyong’o explained that the voice she created for the role was “a composite of influences” for which she researched “laryngeal fractures, vocal cord haemorrhages and [my] own experiences with vocal injury”. In an interview with the New York Times, Nyong’o had cited spasmodic dysphonia – a neurological disorder of which Robert F Kennedy Jr is one of the best known people affected – as a model. The National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association (NSDA) criticised her, saying: “Spasmodic dysphonia is not a creepy voice; it’s not a scary voice. It’s a disability that people are living with and [they] shouldn’t be judged on.” Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, president of non-profit activist group RespectAbility had also protested, saying: “Connecting disabilities to characters who are evil further marginalises people with disabilities, who also have significant abilities and want to contribute to their communities just like anyone else.” However, in the wake of Nyong’o’s apology, RespectAbility released a statement saying: “We hope Nyong’o will use this experience to continue lifting up all marginalized groups including the 1-in-5 people who live with disabilities. In general, the Hollywood practice of using disability primarily to villainise people or to show them as objects of pity needs to end.”",Film
"Talking Horses: punters could be left paying price for terrible precedent The biggest betting race of the year, the Grand National, will be run at Aintree on Saturday. In addition to the millions of pounds staked in the hours before the race, punters sitting on an untold number of ante-post bets, some placed even before the weights were published in February, will also learn their fate. Every one of those ante-post bets was placed in complete confidence that if the horse in question actually made it to the start on 6 April, the punter would get a run for their money. It is the same for every race with an ante-post market – including the Derby, the Gold Cup and many more – and it has been this way for generations. A bet struck in good faith cannot be unilaterally declared void by one of the two parties to the wager. It is a principle that underpins the integrity of the entire gambling market and industry. Or rather, it was until the unwinding of BetBright last month, a week before the Cheltenham Festival no less, when the firm announced that its entire ante-post book, on racing, football and everything else, would be declared void at midnight with all stakes returned. In racing terms, the BetBright situation was largely resolved when 888.com, which had paid £15m to buy the defunct bookies’ technology platform, agreed to honour its ante-post book on the Festival. The liabilities on football, however, were left in limbo until last week when, thanks in large part to the efforts of Rich Ricci, BetBright’s former executive chairman, BetVictor agreed to take on all outstanding ante-post bets (including, presumably, any on the National). While all of BetBright’s 35,000 customers have now been dealt with fairly, a very worrying precedent remains. The justification offered for BetBright’s original decision to void ante-post bets was that it would benefit more punters than it would disadvantage, as punters whose speculative ante-post bets were effectively already losers would get their stake money back. And what is truly astonishing is that, a day or two later, the Gambling Commission, which among other things is supposed to ensure that gambling is conducted in “an open and fair” way, agreed with them. It was, the Commission said, “content that the return of stakes, as part of an orderly closure of the business,” would be “the best option available for the vast majority of customers in what is an unusual and difficult situation.” Defending its stance, the Commission also said that during its enquiries, “the operator highlighted the very real possibility of going into insolvent liquidation if it remained open” which “would have resulted in customers receiving no winnings and no refunds on stakes which had been placed.” It described this as “a significant risk”. This, though, was after BetBright had announced the sale of its tech for £15m, a deal that would have taken many weeks to arrange and could easily have included a mechanism to cover any outstanding potential liabilities, which are believed to have amounted to around £1m. Ante-post bets, by their nature, tend to involve a relatively small stake looking to win at big odds. Everyone involved understands that, on both sides of the wager. Yet the Commission decided– principally it seems on the basis of evidence provided by the bookmaker – that a trifling benefit to a relatively small number of punters outweighed the potentially shattering loss of money and faith for the backers hoping for a huge payout. As a result, we now have a situation where any licensed firm can advertise and lay the best price in the market, safe in the knowledge that they can walk away if their position goes horribly wrong. And the Gambling Commission, it seems, will just let them do it. This undermines the integrity of the entire market, as odds could be advertised in the knowledge that the price will never be honoured. For me, this also suggests a complete disconnection between the Commission and the millions of ordinary punters on whose behalf they are supposedly regulating the gambling industry. When it comes to addressing and preventing problem gambling, it has a reasonable record, as it does on other issues such as preventing under-age gambling and keeping criminality out of the industry. But the Commission seems to have no understanding or interest at all when it comes to a fair deal for those who make up the overwhelming majority of the gambling community. Many thousands are having their accounts restricted or closed because they win. The Commission does not seem to care. And now they cannot place an ante-post bet without wondering whether it will actually be paid. For all its efforts in other areas, the Gambling Commission’s continues to ignore its responsibility to ensure that gambling is “fair and open”. The latest bookie to walk away from ante-post bets was 188Bet last week, and this is a firm that is simply leaving from the UK market while it continues to trade profitably elsewhere. A terrible precedent has been set by the BetBright affair and unless the Commission starts to do its job, punters could be paying the price for many years to come. Monday’s tips Good ground has had a withering effect on the fields at Ludlow on Monday and just four runners go to post for the Boyne Cup handicap chase, with a first prize of £13,000. It is, at least, a four-runner race in which all of the runners go to post with some sort of chance, though Timoteo (3.55) is a solid favourite at around even money. Burn Baby Byrne (4.25) has decent prospects too at a more attractive price, while Greyzee (4.45) should take the 10-furlong handicap at Chelmsford City after an improved performance last time. Silvestre de Sousa, Greyzee’s jockey, is a positive booking for Swiss Cross (3.05) on the same card, while Stargazer (5.45) looks best on the day’s other card at Newcastle.",Sport
"Nipsey Hussle: a hip-hop samaritan who lifted up Los Angeles Ermias Asghedom, the rapper better known as Nipsey Hussle, knew his worth and implored his community to know theirs. Raised in Los Angeles, where he also died on Sunday afternoon in a shooting outside his Marathon Clothing store, Asghedom’s unshakable belief in his own rap and business excellence regularly spilled over into outlandish expressions of that confidence: in 2013 he famously set a $100 price tag for physical copies of his cult acclaimed Crenshaw mixtape (Jay-Z bought 100). Five years later, when his debut album finally materialised, having refused industry attempts to prise an album out of him more quickly or not on his terms, he billed it not as an introduction, but as a celebration of his already established greatness. Victory Lap dropped in February 2018 to rave reviews. He was well within his rights to give his debut full-length such a bold title. His thrilling brand of hip-hop – a gleaming crucible of LA rap styles past and present – across 12 street-acclaimed mixtapes in the run-up to Victory Lap had brought him a place in the hearts of rap A-listers, and increasingly on their hits, too. Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, Childish Gambino and YG were collaborators, with Rihanna and J Cole among his burgeoning brigade of fans. But Nipsey’s success wasn’t limited to music. Growing parallel to his success was an impressive business empire, operated out of his native Slauson Avenue, offering opportunities to local youths and aiming to take his community with him on the route to riches. A barbershop, learning centre for kids, fish store and cryptocurrency company are just some of the ventures he leaves behind, in addition to the clothing store where he was gunned down in an act of violence that’s sent shock waves through the rap world. His mercurial force in both the booth and the boardroom were intertwined, with the black politics surging through anthems such as Dedication (“This ain’t entertainment, it’s for niggas on the slave ship / These songs just spirituals I swam against them waves with,” he spat on that Kendrick-assisted behemoth) mirrored in his work in the community. The day after he died, Asghedom was due to meet with LAPD officials to discuss programmes that could be put in place to curb gang violence. “Artist. Activist. Angeleno,” read the tribute from the LA Lakers basketball team. His death is a loss not just for rap, but for LA at large, and especially the neglected neighbourhood he parlayed so much of success into trying to enrich. It wasn’t all bright: homophobic comments posted to Instagram in October were a blot on his altruism and incredible magnetism on the mic. However, the dominant picture of Hussle emerging today as hip-hop mourns is of a gentle, polite soul and doting boyfriend. (In a February 2019 profile in GQ, his partner Lauren London boasted of Asghedom’s excellent bed-making abilities.) What can’t be questioned is his talent for sumptuous, G-funk-flecked rap. Introspective tracks such as Hussle and Motivate – a homily to financial independence built on a chopped and screwed sample of Hard Knock Life – and recent single Racks in the Middle exhibit unhurried, riveting flows that had Asghedom on course for a place in rap’s elite. That is, if he had wanted it. Asghedom gave the impression in interviews that he may have been about to leave hip-hop behind and focus his efforts on the business empire blossoming in Slauson Avenue. “I got an album concept called Exit Strategy, that might be one of my last ones,” he told Complex after Victory Lap’s release. Whatever his next move was to be, rap has been robbed of a limitlessly talented rap samaritan whose story was just beginning – but whose impact will continue to reverberate.",Music
"How can the news media reach young people? Tell their stories I get to meet our viewers all the time. There’s nothing more sobering than hearing an eight-year-old’s views on Brexit. At Newsround, everything we do is aimed at children. Our job is to try to explain what’s going on in a way they can understand, keeping their minds engaged and their hands away from the exit button. When you’re competing with Baby Shark on YouTube and a million videos about flossing (the dance – not dental hygiene), it can be a real challenge, something that the BBC’s director general Tony Hall has recognised in the corporation’s annual report. Keeping young people informed and interested in the news is what we try to do every day – and we’ve been doing it for almost 50 years. Since the early days when John Craven was its presenter, Newsround’s mission has been to cater for children as young as six, all the way up to early teens. It’s no surprise to anyone who works in the media industry that British kids are spending less time in front of TV sets, a trend I don’t think will change. So we now focus most of our efforts on producing stories for an online audience – which is growing. But still, even today there is a huge appetite for what we do. Teachers tell me they use Newsround to keep the classroom informed and help to spark debate. After school is done for the day, keeping that audience interested in what the BBC has to offer is where the hard work really begins. BBC News is trying to attract young people, with podcasts such as Beyond Today, an extension of the Today brand. The new BBC Sounds app is hoping to tap into the podcast revolution. Short videos on Instagram and other social media platforms attract an audience that might not have turned to the BBC before. Educating younger viewers about fake news is another issue we’ve spent a lot of time covering over the past few years, making them aware that some of the content they look at on their smartphones is completely made up. It’s part of my job to meet and spend time with our audience. We call them “stepping out” sessions and they give me the chance to listen to what kids are talking about in the playground, and find out how important social media is to their lives and what makes them tick. All journalists from the BBC should do this; it’s the best way to find stories and stay in touch with an ever-changing audience. How we tell these stories and the way we deliver them is something we still need to address. The days of a newsreader sitting behind a desk are long gone. When I’m presenting Newsround, I’m talking to our viewers and sharing the latest headlines. It’s got to be personable; they don’t want to hear another teacher and they certainly don’t want to be patronised. Kids these days are so smart; they have so much choice and won’t stick around if they feel we’re talking down to them. For me, representation has a huge role to play: making sure the BBC continues to reflect the audience and speak to communities in some of the toughest and most neglected parts of the UK. I grew up in Tower Hamlets, one of the poorest boroughs in London. Nobody in my family had been to university, we were working class and I certainly didn’t think a job in the BBC was a possibility. But then, one afternoon, I remember seeing Moira Stuart presenting the BBC evening news. She had the same skin colour as me and she was on the BBC. For me, that was a game-changer. I hope I can one day inspire someone from a similar background to choose a career at the BBC. I’ve made it my mission to focus on children in parts of the country that we sometimes forget. Their voices are just as important and their stories need to be told. • Leah Boleto is a presenter of Newsround on CBBC",Opinion
"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chicken with lemon and egg sauce Learning to cook in Italy over the past 14 years hasn’t been so much about learning recipes – although I’ve learned many – rather, it has been about ways of cooking things. The best and most useful of these ways have often been the most blindingly obvious and endlessly variable. A friend describes them as the cooking equivalent – pseuds’ corner, I know – of a musician learning a memorable tune that can be played in many styles. Twice-cooking vegetables, for example – something Italians refer to as ripassare or strascinare – boiling, draining and then dragging the cooked vegetable around a frying pan with olive oil, garlic and chilli. It is a method that can be applied to almost every vegetable, and especially to spinach, chard, turnip tops and the broccoli and cauliflower family. It is way that can be varied by the addition of anchovies (melted to a paste), or red chilli, pancetta, a handful of cherry tomatoes, capers or olives. Vegetables cooked this way can be a side dish topped with breadcrumbs, tossed with pasta (in which case, use the green-tinted, faintly flavoured vegetal water to cook the pasta), put in a pie, or piled on toast. Or the hunter’s chicken principle: brown joints, add seasoning, drown in wine and cook at a lazy blip, burp, until tender and sticky. You can vary it with herbs, add tomato, red peppers or potatoes, and finish with olives and vinegar. Or the browned chicken can be turned into today’s dish, recently eaten on a trip across Italy’s Apennines (during a blizzard) to the sparsely populated yet plainly beautiful region of Le Marche: chicken with lemon and egg sauce. I have come across almost every possible cut for hunter’s chicken – whole, spatchcocked, quartered, jointed into eight or 12 pieces, thighs, bones in, bones out, breasts cut into strips ... But I particularly like two of these ways. The first uses a whole chicken: pollo alla moda di macerata, as it is described (and idiosyncratically illustrated) in the excellent Marche edition of La Cucina delle Regioni d’Italia. For this method, you first brown, then roast a whole chicken – covered, so it produces lots of juices – in the oven. Once the chicken is cooked, you cut or tear it into bits, put them on a platter, then mix the egg and lemon into the hot juices left in the tin, and pour over the meat. The second way is with pieces of chicken, which can be done entirely on the stovetop. While you can make the sauce in the pan, you risk scrambling the egg. I learned a useful way from a chef called Sara Levi. You mix two egg yolks, the zest and juice of a lemon, some salt and pepper, and a handful of finely chopped parsley in a big bowl, then, using a slotted spoon, lift in the hot cooked joints and toss. There’s a knack to this that Italians use for tossing pasta: a sliding jolt or flip away from you, then an abrupt stop, so the sauce underneath rises like a tidal wave, up and over the joints. Or you can stir with a spoon. Either way, the aim is that tossing the chicken in the sauce should thicken the egg and lemon into a rich and silken sauce that clings to the meat. Tip on to a platter, then scrape over any juices left in the bottom of the pan. Chicken with lemon and egg Prep 10 min Cook 45 min Serves 4 50g butter 2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely diced 1.2kg chicken joints or thighs, or 800g boned-out thighs, each cut into three pieces Salt and black pepper 1 pinch red chilli flakes Juice of 1½ lemons 250ml chicken or vegetable stock, or white wine 2 egg yolks Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon 1 heaped tbsp chopped parsley In a large saute pan, melt the butter and oil over a medium-low flame, and fry the onion until soft and very pale golden. Working in batches, if necessary, add the chicken, skin-side down to the pan and brown, then turn and brown the other side. Season with salt, pepper and chilli flakes, pour over the juice of half a lemon, the stock or wine, bring to a bubble, then reduce to a gentle simmer. At this point, if you are using a jointed chicken, you might like to lift out the breast – return it to the pot in the last five minutes of cooking time. Cover with a lid, and cook for 30 minutes if you are using boned thighs, 45 minutes if you are using jointed chicken. The chicken should be tender, with almost all the liquid evaporated, apart from a few sticky juices. Remove the pot from the heat. In a large bowl, beat together the yolks, zest, remaining lemon juice and the parsley. Using a slotted spoon, lift the hot chicken into the bowl, then toss energetically: the heat and movement will thicken the egg and lemon into a rich, satin-like sauce that will coat the surface of the chicken. Tip on to a warm plate, pour and scrape over any juices from the pan on top, and serve with boiled potatoes or buttered rice and a green salad.",Food
"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for date and tahini cake with sticky toffee sauce If you visit the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, you will find an Assyrian horse built from cans of date syrup. It is a political statement. Dates are the most ancient cultivated fruit, with archaeological evidence suggesting they were farmed in the region (now Iraq) as far back as 5000BC. There are more than 600 varieties of dates in Iraq. Due to sanctions still imposed on Iraq today, it is near-impossible to buy date syrup direct from Iraq, but you can get other types online. It’s delicious, thought to contain high levels of antibacterial compounds and a brilliantly versatile ingredient. Date, tahini and cardamom cake with toffee-date sauce This gently spiced cake is ethereally light, wonderfully sticky and an all-round treat. Prep 20 min Cook 1 hr Serves 8-10 100g pitted good-quality dates (I like Anjoman) 250g date syrup 120g tahini 180g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 20g extra for greasing 120g soft brown sugar 4 eggs 100g walnuts, roughly chopped 200g self‑raising flour 2 tsp baking powder ½ tsp ground cardamom seeds ¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg ½ tsp salt For the sticky toffee sauce 60g butter 150g date syrup 200g double cream Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas mark 3. Grease a 24cm square baking tray (or equivalent) and line with greaseproof paper. Put the dates, date syrup and tahini in a bowl and blitz to a puree with a stick blender, adding two tablespoons of water to help loosen the mixture. Cream the butter and sugar using a wooden spoon or an electric beater, until light and fluffy. Beat in the date mixture, followed by the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the walnuts. Sift the flour, baking powder, spices and salt into the wet mixture, stirring in between sifting, until all the ingredients are fully combined. Pour into the prepared tray and bake for 55-60 minutes, until a knife comes out almost, but not completely, clean. While the cake is baking, make the sticky sauce. Put the butter and date syrup in a small saucepan and stir over a medium heat, until completely combined. Stir in the cream. Serve slices of the sponge with the warm, sticky sauce. And for the rest of the week... Mix equal parts tahini and date syrup to make a paste that you can spread on bread or mix into yoghurt for breakfast; I also use it to sweeten breakfast muffins. Spread it over a shoulder of lamb or venison, for a sticky, sweet glaze. Make hummus with leftover tahini or mix with smashed avocado for lunch.",Food
"Borussia Dortmund's late show gives Bundesliga title race jolt of electricity All roads lead to Munich. At the end of a week in which it was announced France’s World Cup-winning defender Lucas Hernández would arrive at Bayern in the summer – after the champions paid a fee almost double the Bundesliga’s existing highest for an incoming player – Marco Reus will also head for Bavaria, as a Borussia Dortmund player, of course, but there had been doubt about the captain making the journey. This weekend Reus’s first child, a baby girl, arrived a few days earlier than expected, freeing daddy up to lead his side in what could be the defining game of their season. A week before Bayern and Dortmund meet in the season’s final Klassiker, at the Allianz Arena next Saturday, the scales of the Bundesliga tipped again during stoppage time on Saturday afternoon as the two played simultaneously, 460km apart. Bayern spurned a couple of more-than-presentable match points at Freiburg, with Robert Lewandowski sending a free header wide from close range, shortly before Leon Goretzka’s header hit the post and the Poland No 9 put the rebound over the top. Dortmund, however, looked like they would not take advantage of only Bayern’s second failure to win in their last 15 Bundesliga matches. They went past the 90-minute mark at home to Wolfsburg at 0-0, blunted without Reus against a team habitually so dogged away from home. Then came Paco Alcácer, firstly thrashing home a free-kick from just outside the area, and then scuffing in a second after Jadon Sancho played him in at the end of a counter-attack. The goals took Dortmund where few in recent weeks imagined them being – going to Munich next week back at the top of the table, with two points more to their tally than the champions. Hans-Joachim Watzke commented, with a lorryload of understatement, that going into Der Klassiker in front was “psychologically good,” but the last few games have been just that. BVB have flirted hard with the death of the title dream, going into stoppage time in Berlin a fortnight ago drawing with Hertha before Reus struck the decisive blow, and now this. It’s the best possible habit at the best possible time and the feeling seems to be that it’s more than luck. “If you judge it over the season,” Mario Götze told Sky, “then it’s a quality of ours, that we know we can still make games happen for us.” Der Klassiker could have been a procession but now, it’s an opportunity, even if Bayern – on the back of seven straight Bundesliga home wins – are now the clear favourites. The wobbles that Niko Kovač’s side experienced at the Allianz in autumn, against Augsburg and Fortuna Düsseldorf (not to mention Freiburg, surely now their chief irritant of this far tighter than expected season), seem like a long time ago. They weren’t their assured selves in the Black Forest, though, going a goal down in three minutes to a clearly pumped-up home side, with Lucas Höler nodding past Sven Ulreich as Manuel Neuer sat out with a sore calf. Lewandowski scored an equaliser but the flow wasn’t quite there, despite Bayern laying siege in the closing stages to the Freiburg goal, in which Alexander Schwolow played a blinder. If luck played a role, especially in those confounding final minutes, it felt like a generational thing as well, with Serge Gnabry continuing his Germany form after replacing a quiet Thomas Müller 10 minutes into the second half (with that said, the rested Javi Martínez was missed in midfield). With Jogi Löw watching from the stands for the first time since he unceremoniously dumped them from the national team, neither Müller, Jérôme Boateng or Mats Hummels – with the latter exposed for Höler’s opener – did much to suggest the coach had been wrong. “The German national coach has made an art form of his own inscrutability,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Benedikt Warmbrunn. “On Saturday afternoon, however, everyone could see how Joachim Löw looks at the world.” The annoyance in the Bayern camp at the slow start that undermined them was evident, both in the post-match words of Kovač and Goretzka. “We were asleep in the first five minutes,” lamented the midfielder, “despite talking about it 700 times in the dressing room.” The start certainly underlined why the club have been so swift to make defensive reinforcements, with the signings of Hernández and Benjamin Pavard likely to be just the start of significant investment. The question is whether Dortmund can find the spark to take advantage of their current position – a spark which, despite their late flourish, wasn’t always evident on Saturday – or if Bayern’s old guard can summon what might be a last hurrah. With a title race for once still alive and kicking in spring, it promises to be fun finding out. Talking points • Just off the summit, it was a great weekend for Leipzig. What had looked for months like a side treading water until the arrival of their shiny new coach, Julian Nagelsmann, in the summer is now veering excitedly to a glorious season’s end. They annihilated Hertha 5-0 on Saturday, with Yussuf Poulsen scoring a hat-trick and thus surpassing the more celebrated Timo Werner as the club’s top scorer this season so far – no hard feelings, with Werner spurning the opportunity for a shot to lay on an easy opener for Poulsen instead – after Emil Forsberg had opened the floodgates for only the Swede’s second goal of an injury-frustrated season. There is also possible silverware on the horizon, with a very-winnable DfB Pokal quarter-final at Augsburg on Tuesday. • Borussia Mönchengladbach might well look on in envy after their humbling defeat after the short trip to Fortuna Düsseldorf. They were 3-0 down after 16 minutes, and furious coach Dieter Hecking made his point by substituting the not-injured Thorgan Hazard before half-time. “I think we could have all been taken off in the first half,” sympathised Matthias Ginter but with one win and four defeats in the last seven, Gladbach are in danger of throwing away a campaign of mostly excellent work. To cap it all, Eintracht Frankfurt brushed aside Stuttgart in the late game on Sunday to leapfrog Gladbach into fourth, with Filip Kostić scoring twice. • Schalke were able to make the most of their fortune – with Stuttgart losing and Augsburg taking a 3-0 hiding at surely-doomed Nürnberg – by winning their first game since the return of Huub Stevens and moving six points clear of the relegation play-off spot. They really had no other option at bottom club Hannover, and €11m signing Suat Serdar got a slick winner, his first goal for the club, entirely out of keeping with a fractious battle. “I wasn’t even looking at the goal,” admitted Serdar. He was probably due the luck, and his team might need some more as they head into a challenging-looking Pokal quarter-final against in-form Werder Bremen.",Football
"Get me out of here! Why escape rooms have become a global craze In 60 minutes – and the clock has just begun ticking – Prof Blacksheep will have hacked the computer mainframe in the abandoned lab of his arch-nemesis, Mr Q, who is a mouse. The professor, who accidentally turned himself into a sheep during an experiment to gain animal superpowers, wants to do more dark stuff with genes and unleash a global internet supervirus. My job, as a secret agent, is to stop it and save the world after first shrinking myself to mouse size to get into the lab. I’ve had simpler nights out in north London, where I am confined to the basement of a former nightclub. My other mission, beyond the whole sheep-hacking thing, is to explore the rise of the escape room. After five years of steep growth – there are now almost 1,500 escape rooms across Britain – this upstart entertainment hybrid is mutating into something mainstream. Eleven days from now, Red Bull, the energy drink more commonly associated with extreme sports, will stage the Escape Room world championships in Shoreditch, London. Four-strong teams from 23 countries will travel to the event, which will culminate in Omni’s Escape, a room that will have an ethical theme involving artificial intelligence, designed by Scott Nicholson, a professor of gaming in Ontario, Canada. Meanwhile, entertainment giants are realising that escape rooms can give new life to their worlds and characters. Doctor Who rooms have just arrived in Bristol, Leeds, Oxford, Manchester, Reading and Birmingham; an official BBC Sherlock escape room opened in London in December, featuring original footage of the show’s stars. “Pretty much all the major entertainment companies with significant intellectual property are looking at escape rooms now,” says Ken Ferguson, a blogger and consultant who helped create the Red Bull event. I find Prof Blacksheep at clueQuest, an escape room company run by four Hungarian brothers. I am joined by one half of the British team for the Red Bull championships; Sarah Dodd and Sharan Gill are a power couple who have completed more than 1,500 games around the world. They will be showing me Origenes, clueQuest’s newest game, based in King’s Cross, London. The company opened its first room in Tottenham in 2013, when it was only the second such facility in London. There are now 136 games at more than 50 venues in the capital, including one in a former church just over the road. Origenes starts in the Shrink-o-mat, where we have to work out how to shrink ourselves and gain access to the lab. It looks like a bathroom on Starship Enterprise. There are flashing lights, mysterious wheels and cogs, miles of exposed circuitry, and compartments bearing strange symbols. Bolted to all the MDF, which has been artfully rendered as grimy steel, a screen shows the countdown clock. As an escape room newbie, I have no idea where to begin. I’ve never really been into gaming, puzzles – or locked rooms – and have an aversion to organised fun (call it stag fatigue; happily I’m now deep into the Netflix and soft-play stage of life). But I’m, well, game – and glad to be in a team of pros. “We always start a room by just trying things,” says Dodd, who was a doctor before her move into gaming. Gill, a civil engineer, reaches inside some of the boxes attached to the wall. “So if you put your hand in this one you can feel a handprint and in here I can feel bumps,” she says. “Is it … a pattern?” As Dodd and Gill do their thing, working around each other like fast-forwarded detectives at a movie murder scene, I can begin to see the appeal. There is the childlike thrill of exploring a strange world made real. Then the satisfaction of discovery as patterns suggest themselves. The bumps Gill feels match the combination lock on the far wall, it turns out. There are several more around the room, and a different bump – or button – is depressed in each one. Together they produce a string of numbers, but what is the order? And what do we do with it? I feel immediately immersed in the story, however silly it is. “If I read a book I can’t be the protagonist or touch it,” Dodd says. “In escape rooms I can.” The escape room trend is late to bloom in the UK, yet has roots in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons craze that started in the 1970s, and the adventure games that were big on British television in the 1980s. Now Get Out of That (1981) and the sci-fi themed The Adventure Game, which started in 1980, pre-dated the most successful adventure show of them all: The Crystal Maze, which first aired in 1990. That trend fed into computer gaming, which had spawned “escape the room” titles in Japan. In 2007, Takao Kato, a 34-year-old publishing employee, launched his first Real Escape Game in Kyoto. Teams were given an hour to decipher clues and find hidden objects to get out. “I wondered why interesting things didn’t happen in my life, like they did in books,” Kato, a manga fan, told the Japan Times in 2009. “I thought I could create my own adventure, a story, and then invite people to be a part of it.” As the rooms spread across Asia and America, Hungary emerged as Europe’s escape room crucible when, in 2011, Attila Gyurkovics, a former social worker, launched the Parapark franchise. Escape rooms in Budapest multiplied in empty buildings with low rents and cool cellars. The country has a heritage of puzzling: Ernő Rubik sold his first cube in Budapest in 1977. In 2012, Attila Nagy and Csaba Vinkler, two thirtysomething Hungarians, opened Britain’s first escape room in north London. HintHunt is now a global chain. Escape rooms quickly appealed to a nostalgic generation of Brits who had grown up watching Crystal Maze and playing low-fi computer games. “People were also starting to move away from their screens,” says Zoltan “Zoli” Papp, 31, one of the brothers from Budapest who launched clueQuest. PLAN52, its first game, involved a similar mix of clues and puzzles with a secret-agent theme. Gigi, Zoltan’s brother, a puzzle fiend and former PE teacher, led the design. ClueQuest has welcomed more than 55,000 groups through its imaginatively locked doors. Dodd and Gill, who have been together for five years, caught the escape room bug in 2016. They, too, were looking for something new that didn’t involve a screen, to celebrate Dodd’s birthday. They were into games and puzzles, but the visceral thrill of escape rooms immediately seduced them. “I can also get out of the house with friends and have a drink afterwards. It’s not solitary,” Dodd says, adding: “Ultimately, humans like escapism and adventure, and to challenge themselves … and we gain most satisfaction from doing these things in a group of friends.” Dodd has hit pause on her NHS career to become an escape room consultant, podcaster and writer. She co-founded the UK Escape Room Industry Conference, which welcomed more than 450 owners to its second event in London last October. She advises Houdini’s Escape Room Experience, which started in Southampton in 2016, and has just won a contract to open rooms within more than 40 bowling alleys operated by the Tenpin company. As they did in Budapest, escape rooms often thrive in spaces that may not be otherwise viable. They have sprung up in castles, pubs, warehouses and disused underground stations. Startup costs can be low for those willing to put in the hours. Last June, Nick Scott, a former set builder, launched Cave Escape in a vacant shop in a former lace factory in Nottingham. “It’s something people can come and do that isn’t sitting in a cinema for two hours in silence,” he says. Papp says his rooms unite generations, often drawing teens from their screens into family activities. Groups of adults arrive with memories of The Crystal Maze. The show gave the escape room trend a boost in 2016 when a temporary live experience opened in north London, complete with an Aztec zone, retro bomber jackets and a gold ticket-filled Crystal Dome. Two new Crystal Maze experiences have just opened in central London and Manchester. Nick Moran came from an immersive theatre background; he launched Time Run, an elaborately produced escape room with a time-travel theme, in east London, in 2015. Thousands played, including Stephen Moffat and Sue Vertue, the couple behind Hartswood Films. They showed up one evening with Mark Gatiss, the co-creator of Sherlock, which Hartswood makes for the BBC. “They all loved it,” Moran recalls. “They didn’t have plans for a new season any time soon and had wanted to make a live experience. So we sat in a room and talked.” Moran launched Sherlock: The Game Is Now after almost two years of development, offering players the chance to emulate the detective. He says he is surprised that it has taken this long for the trend to go fully mainstream. While many incorporate sophisticated technology – the room I am in is controlled by more than 40 computers – the trend is not driven by it. As Moran puts it, they’re “a decisively offline social experience”. Elsewhere, museums and schools are exploiting escape rooms as interactive alternatives to historical reenactment or creepy waxworks of old sailors. Nicholson, the academic who designed the Red Bull game, has created an escape-room-inspired game for Canadian schools about the country’s electoral system. “Escape rooms have something other group activities don’t have because they are not about competition but collaboration,” he says. “We now want to design games that can make a real difference.” At clueQuest, Dodd and Gill welcome mainstream attention if it dispels some of the myths around escape rooms. They are not scary, Dodd says, and very few have an explicit horror theme. The couple were disappointed in Escape Room, Hollywood’s latest take on the trend, in which six players end up in a series of death traps. The film jarred uncomfortably with a real tragedy, coming out just weeks after five teenage girls died in a fire in a Polish escape room in January. All the doors at clueQuest have a release button and are never genuinely locked. “I don’t like being scared and I’m claustrophobic,” Dodd says. “That’s not what it’s about.” I have promised Papp that I will not reveal the secrets of the Origenes game. But I can report that it is captivating yet fiendishly difficult. Only 20% of teams succeed, even with hints from the control room. Dodd’s and Gill’s brains work on a different level from mine, spotting patterns and remembering sequences with startling ease. With their help – a lot of it – I shrink myself and gain access to the lab. Our task there is to understand and manipulate an array of giant objects in search for codes. There is a giant padlock, a giant floppy disc and a lot of clever lighting and moving parts. With 17 minutes to spare, we manage to save the world (you’re welcome). Slightly breathless, and more energised than I have felt doing anything that isn’t actual sport, I return to the Shrink-o-mat to get back to human size – and reality.",Games
"The saga of Gwyneth, Apple and Instagram is a parenting classic The Insta pic shows two faces: a smiling Gwyneth Paltrow, and a girl half of whose face is covered by ski goggles. On the surface of it, innocent enough, but the post has turned out to be incendiary, and Paltrow’s feed is full of comments criticising her parenting. Some complain she’s not listening to her daughter; others seem to suggest that she’s allowing the girl to walk all over her. The issue is the presence of the girl wearing goggles. She is Paltrow’s daughter, Apple Martin; and though her face isn’t fully visible, it seems she objected to the post, writing a comment (now removed) that read: “Mom we have discussed this. You may not post anything without my consent.” Apple is 14; in my experience, that’s precisely the moment when daughters decide they no longer want to have their lives curated through their mother’s prism. I know, because I have four daughters – now aged between 17 and 26 – and I’ve been publishing photos of them in the Guardian and other publications, alongside articles I’ve written about parenting, for more than a quarter of a century; certainly a lot longer than social media has been around. There are images of them as small babies, and pictures of them in their school uniforms. Photos of them having fun on day trips and holidays, and specially shot groups that sometimes involved them posing for professional photographers. Writing about parenting is my job, and editors need photos – so the request for images almost always followed a commission. For a long time, my daughters were fine with it; but then, in their mid-teens, they rebelled. Yes, they knew it helped my work; but no, they were no longer willing to be bit-players in my interpretation of their story. For one thing, they often had very different ideas from me (or my editor) about which pictures they looked best in. For another, they were now curating their own lives, posting their own images online. And these, by the way, were extremely carefully chosen, and posts were actually rather rare – at least in an entirely public domain. Today I am wary about publishing even an occasional photograph of my girls on Instagram, let alone asking whether they’d appear in a newspaper piece. I totally get where Apple is coming from: there comes a point when you start to be responsible for your own image, and that’s the point she has arrived at. There are all sorts of nuances surrounding what sort of image is OK and what isn’t; it’s about handing over control, just one of the many ways in which we parents have to hand over control to our children. In a digital world, it equates to the moment they start choosing their own clothes, or expressing a preference for which school they’ll go to next. Parents have always found this handover tough. For one thing, it comes upon us so quickly. One minute they’re photogenic babies in their sun hats on the beach; the next they’re moody teenagers telling us what they will and won’t do. It’s tricky territory; on the one hand they’re still entirely dependent on us, on the other hand they’re flexing their muscles for the independence that is, in the final analysis, the end-goal of parenting. So I feel for Paltrow too, because it seems to me that being proud of our children is an entirely natural state for parents. Sure, we can’t live through them (and Paltrow, who has a big life of her own, certainly isn’t doing that). But, you know, we’ve given a lot of time to them; and we want to celebrate them, on the happy days, and share the fun. So let’s not be too down on a parent for doing just that. Meanwhile, for Apple I suspect the crux of the issue is not the picture itself, but her relationship with her mother; and the important lesson she’ll have learned from this past week is that there are many arguments it’s better to restrict to the family WhatsApp thread, rather than posting on the world wide web. • Joanna Moorhead writes about parenting and family life",Opinion
"UK 'silver spoon' cabinet will escape Brexit fallout, says German minister Germany’s Europe minister has accused “90 percent” of the British cabinet of having “no idea how workers think, live, work and behave”, as politicians in the union are finding Westminster turmoil to be a useful argument in the campaign for upcoming elections. At the Social Democratic party’s (SPD) conference on Saturday, Michael Roth dispensed with diplomatic etiquette to condemn what he called the “big shitshow” of Brexit. UK politicians “born with silver spoons in their mouths, who went to private schools and elite universities” were responsible for the current impasse in parliament, but were unlikely to suffer the direct consequences of their actions, he said. “I don’t know if William Shakespeare could have come up with such a tragedy but who will foot the bill?” asked Roth, 48, who has been Europe minister since 2013. Last week the old Etonian Jacob Rees-Mogg mocked fellow Conservative MPs in the House of Commons over the public school they went to, describing alumni of Winchester College as “characteristically ... highly intelligent but fundamentally wrong”. The chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group has since been criticised for tweeting a video of a speech by one of the co-leaders of Germany’s populist party Alternative für Deutschland. In one poster for the European parliament election campaign, the German Social Democrats use an image of the Conservative MP Boris Johnson suspended from a zip-wire, alongside the words: “Brexit? Europe is the answer.” At the SPD conference, Roth said the European parliament elections at the end of May would become a “a choice of destiny” between a “free Europe” and one run by “nationalists and populists”. “Europe is a life insurance in times of crisis and Europe brings the opportunity to cross borders, destroy walls, bring people together and foster solidarity,” Roth said. “We are seeing these days how fragile that is, and how little we can take that for granted. When people give themselves up to nationalists and populists, they are betrayed.”",Politics
"Tania Mallet, Tilly Masterson in James Bond film Goldfinger, dies aged 77 Tania Mallet, the model and actor who played Tilly Masterson in the 1964 Bond film Goldfinger, has died aged 77. The official James Bond Twitter account confirmed the news, saying: “We are very sorry to hear that Tania Mallet who played Tilly Masterson in Goldfinger has passed away. Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this sad time.” The third Bond film after Dr No and From Russia With Love, Goldfinger memorably begins with the murder of Goldfinger’s assistant Jill Masterson after she is covered in gold paint. Mallet played Masterson’s sister Tilly, who attempts to kill Goldfinger in revenge, but is herself killed by Oddjob’s steel-rimmed bowler hat. Mallet, who was born in Blackpool in 1941, was a successful model in the late 50s and early 60s, part of the same generation as the likes of Celia Hammond and Jean Shrimpton. She twice appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1961, and was in Michael Winner’s short documentary Girls Girls Girls! in the same year, as one of three flatmates trying to make it in London’s fashionable occupations. Mallet is seen acquiring poise after receiving tuition from the Lucie Clayton model school. After being spotted by Bond producer Alfred “Cubby” Broccoli in a photoshoot, Mallet was auditioned for From Russia With Love, and then cast in Goldfinger, though she later said she thought the money on offer – £50 a week – was “dreadful”, far less than she would earn per day as a model, so she demanded and received a threefold increase. Despite Goldfinger’s high profile, Mallet said it was “not difficult” to turn her back on the film industry and return to modelling: “I was always more comfortable in a small studio with just the photographer and his assistant.” She also said she felt stifled by the restrictions the acting contracts – such as being unable to go abroad, or being banned from horseriding – placed on her lifestyle. Helen Mirren was Mallet’s first cousin, and described her in her autobiography as “impossibly beautiful and kind” and “a loyal and generous person”, using her earnings to pay for her brothers’ education and supporting her mother.",Film
"April Fools' Day 2019: the best jokes and pranks in one place In an era when you can wake up to the headline “Mussolini’s granddaughter slams Jim Carrey over political cartoons” and it not be a prank, you might think the traditional April fools’ joke online has had its day. But you’d be wrong. Here are some of the best, and worst, of 2019’s efforts. Newspapers The Daily Express reported that Britain may face a permanent exit from the Eurovision song contest, due to a ruling by L’Institute de Eurovision Song. A spokesperson is quoted as saying “It is unfortunate for British music fans, but we have a duty to protect the performers and music fans from other member states.” The Telegraph suggested that parliament was reviving an Oliver Cromwell-era statute to prohibit April Fool jokes, for fear they would spark panic-buying. The paper wrote: “The statute from 1653 states that the issuing of false reports is strictly prohibited and punishable by the splitting of an offender’s ribs.” A statute that would possibly be useful all year round. The Brexit jokes crossed international boundaries, too, with Malta Today reporting there were moves to revoke the George Cross medal awarded to Malta by King George VI in 1942. The Sun, meanwhile, claimed there would be a Royal Mint collection of coin designs based on emojis, including a poo emoji 50p, while the Daily Star reckons we’ll now be able to get beer on the NHS. Apparently “Guinness is good for you” after all. The Times reports that dog owners can now get drones to do walkies for them. The devices would also be able to pick up and bin any dog mess. There had, apparently, been some mishaps with the prototypes, and reports that an excited Yorkshire Terrier was seen hovering over Gatwick before Christmas were left unconfirmed. The Daily Mail had news that Larry the Downing Street cat was getting its own catflap in the famous door to No 10. British Transport police The British Transport police have stepped up and announced new £2,000 fines for eating smelly snacks on the go. It would be difficult to have a smelly snack on this new transport initiative though – a 100mph zipwire across the Severn Bridge linking Wales to England, announced on Monday and scheduled to open on 1 April 2020. Another new feature planned for Wales is a giant Hollywood-style sign for the hills of Cwmbran. And Holyhead is getting a rival one too. Hello Fresh Food delivery service Hello Fresh say they have launched a unicorn box option, with enough glitter, frosting and sugar to please even the most demanding toddler. Lego &amp; McDonalds It is funny how there are some proposed April fool products that instantly make you scream: “Yes, I want that!” And some that have entirely the opposite effect: We’re just not even sure where to begin with Colman’s Mustard Custard, which they claim tastes “equally delicious with roast beef and parsnips as it does with an apple crumble or a sticky toffee pudding” Google Pick of the tech jokes this year is Google Tulip. With an extremely detailed technical spec and glossy promotional video, this development allows you to talk to your tulips, and discover just what it is they are thinking about. Spoiler alert: sunshine, soil and water. Google has also introduced a temporary playable version of Nokia-phone classic game Snake within Google Maps. Tinder Tinder, meanwhile, claims to have finally solved the problem of men lying about their height on the dating app, with a new height verification feature they promise is coming soon. Men are instructed to post a picture of themselves in front of any commercial building. From this, Tinder promises to calculate your true height and give you a verification badge on your profile. The world of sport Exciting news for fans of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who are set to renames themselves Brighton, Hove and Lancing Wanderers following their newly announced move to a new 80,000 all-seater stadium in Lancing. Their present ground will be turned into a vegan market and drop-in centre. Elsewhere, former Premier League manager Ian Holloway has apparently been appointed as the new kicking coach for rugby union’s Worcester. Oxford University If you are worried about AI taking over the world, maybe you can relax a little after seeing Oxford University’s research into getting a computer to play snap, a project that appears to have given a machine all of the game-playing prowess of a small child. Capcom There is good April fools news for zombies though. Capcom, responsible for a series of games in the zombie-shooting genre, are looking to hire some replacement zombies. If you apply, you get to find out which zombie you have been allocated. No sex please, we’re the BBC The BBC’s iPlayer is getting a valuable update – a “skip the sex” button for those awkward moments when you are watching a programme with your parents or your children and it is about to get steamy. Doctor Who fans, meanwhile, could be forgiven for treating with some scepticism the announcement that David Tennant and Billie Piper were returning to the BBC as the Doctor and Rose in a new spin-off entitled Meta-Crisis. Animals Marsupials enjoy April Fools’ Day just as much as the rest of us, and this year there is the revelation that koalas can be made even cuter. Which? magazine also had an important announcement – they are back in the business of reviewing and ranking pets. And Cambridgeshire police are introducing the drug sniffer bunny. The Guardian As for the Guardian, in among our Brexit coverage on Monday you may have spotted the unsurprising news that it is going to take a huge effort to pull the country back together after the divisive nature of the referendum and its aftermath. You may have found the names mentioned to spearhead this effort slightly more puzzling, though. And if you need any inspiration for yourself for next year, remember, you can’t go wrong with googly-eyes… And this is just beautiful. Although not the kind of thing you will find in Britain’s first government approved Jedi faith school.",From the Guardian
"Why would one man read Mark Twain's whole library? What if you could make a list of everything Mark Twain ever read and of every book he ever owned? Dr Alan Gribben, cofounder of the Mark Twain Circle of America, has spent the last 45 years doing just that. But why? For more recent authors such as Philip Roth or John Updike, the idea of chronicling their reading isn’t unusual: Roth willed his book collection to Newark Public Library in New Jersey; Updike’s went to Harvard University’s Houghton Library. But Roth and Updike were both a different sort of writer. They lived in our era, and on land. As a steamboat captain, Twain – real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens – lived on the river, his life and work in constant motion as he authored travelogues, time-travel novels and adventure stories about runaway slaves. Would he have wanted a list out there, nailing down the precise location of every book he had owned? Whether he would or not, literary scholars do. In the New Historicism school of literary thought, writing is examined in its authorial context. Heaven forbid someone read Twain’s story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County and think it’s just a funny tale. To understand it, New Historicists must know everything frog-related that could have been in Twain’s mind while writing. What was the sociopolitical perception of frogs in 1865? Did Twain keep a pet amphibian as a child? What books did he read about frogs? Answering the last of these questions has been difficult. In addition to riverboating, Twain held other jobs that required travel: prospector, reporter, lecturer. Logistically, he couldn’t keep many books and those he did carry were often lost. A trunk’s worth disappeared on one transatlantic voyage, and he once recalled leaving a copy of Robinson Crusoe on a train. Twain’s daughter, Susy, once described him as “the loveliest man I ever saw, or ever hope to see, and oh, so absent-minded!” In Twain’s defence, many other famous writers made work hard for scholars by misplacing their books. F Scott Fitzgerald lost his between moves, and Ernest Hemingway left an untold number in Cuba. As a result, between the 1940s and 60s, explains Gribben, “meticulous studies [were] initiated to identify the contents of ... major American authors’ libraries”, cataloging what Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson and others had read. Yet somehow Twain got left out and, as Gribben notes, those studying him “had to check dozens of disparate sources that revealed bits of his literary knowledge”. Well, not anymore. In Mark Twain’s Literary Resources, a three-volume work of literary criticism to be published in May, Gribben outlines the reading that influenced Twain, from Shakespeare to Poe. While scholars will certainly benefit, the book itself is more than academic. It’s a labour of love, with Gribben describing how he uncovered Twain’s tomes in basement boxes, even finding some in sacks by the side of a road. He also had to navigate fakes, books with counterfeit autographs and annotations made by the notorious forger and murderer Mark Hofmann. During his life, Twain could be evasive about his reading, claiming in 1886 that he couldn’t name 100 authors. Other times, he willingly shared his habits with the press, telling New York World Sunday Magazine precisely how many hours he read each day, at what time, and where. “Perhaps it is some type of karma that this well-travelled writer should have his family’s library collection spread out across the land,” says Gribben, noting the Twain family owned more than 3,000 books, and the humourist is known to have read nearly 5,000 literary works. This, Gribben states, may make doubting critics see Twain as a great author, not merely a funny man from Missouri. History may not have preserved writers’ libraries as we now do, but there is one thing about literaria that hasn’t changed – the false notion that great words only come from those in the right places. “Twain was, from the beginning, dismissed by many elite critics,” Gribben says. “Even today, there are those who look down their noses at Twain as an unrefined upstart, a lucky opportunist who gained fame merely on the basis of his outrageous humour.” By proving Twain read the greats, Gribben shows the world he was one.",Books
"'That took long enough!' Black ballerinas finally get shoes to match their skin When Ballet Black pack their bags for their coming spring tour, there’ll be some unusual footwear among their costumes. Not just the wellies they wear to portray striking South African miners in Ingoma, their latest work, but dozens of pairs of pointe shoes that are making their own little piece of history. Ballet Black have collaborated with shoemaker Freed to create the UK’s first pointe shoes in colours to match black and mixed-race skin tones. The new shoes come in two versions, bronze and brown, and they’re a huge leap forward for inclusion in the ballet world. Indeed, the most common reaction from outside ballet, says troupe director Cassa Pancho, has been shock that they didn’t already exist. “I was a bit put out by that,” says Pancho. “All the effort that’s gone into this and the first thing they say is, ‘That took long enough!’ But you forget how different the dance world is to the wider world.” Freed is one of the world’s leading pointe shoe brands, hand-making 300,000 pairs a year. But until now, every one of them was a pale peachy-pink. The ballet shoe was originally designed to look as if the dancer had bare feet, foot and leg in one seamless line, but of course dancers don’t come in one standard-issue colour. And with the rising profile of black dancers – the likes of Misty Copeland, Michaela DePrince and Precious Adams – the ballet world is slowly coming to terms with reality. Freed weren’t the first to notice, though. US company Gaynor Minden launched a new colour range in 2017, but Freed has always been a favourite brand among professionals – and when you find the shoe that works, you tend to stick with it. After people’s shock, says Pancho, came fascination. “It caught hold of the public’s imagination in a way I don’t think Freed or Ballet Black had anticipated,” she says. “We’ve had media from France, America, Brazil, Japan, Greece. We’ve made so many TV and radio pieces about the shoes – and unfortunately, in every one, they want to see our dancer Cira Robinson pancaking some pink shoes. So she’s actually done more pancaking since the brown shoes came out than she’d ever done before.” Pancaking is what dancers do to make their shoes match their skin colour by covering them in makeup. For Robinson, it was just part of the ritual involved in preparing your pointe shoes for dance: darning the ends, sewing ribbons on, breaking them in. Even when she danced with New York’s Dance Theatre of Harlem, where almost all the dancers are black or Hispanic, there was little disquiet about it, other than how time-consuming it was. “It was just how it was,” she says. “Before shows, at break-times, everyone was always pancaking.” Robinson actually felt more uncomfortable about ballet’s traditional pink tights, which didn’t match the rest of her body. “Pancaking is a tradition,” says Robinson, “but ballet is also about inclusion. And the pink tights are, you know, ouch!” Freed is now also manufacturing tights to match the new footwear shades. One dancer who has already ordered hers is 12-year-old Afrozina Abaraonye, a student at Ballet Black’s dance school in London since the age of three. “Because I’ve been wearing pink since I was little, I’ve got used to it,” she says. “But there was always that weird thing when I was standing next to my friends and the pink ballet tights and shoes always looked better on them.” On darker skins, pink tights sometimes give the girls’ legs a bluish-grey tinge, her mum points out. Abaraonye is impatient for her order – bronze pointe shoes and matching tights – to arrive. “I think I’m going to feel really happy because I won’t look awkward with my brown arms and white legs among the other girls. It’s just going to look right.” Pancho echoes this point: “To walk in and see shoes in your own skin colour is a real change in the ballet world. So it might not seem like much that one little shop in London is doing this, but it’s a really significant change.” Orders have been flowing in since October, especially from South America, South Africa and New York. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. “The message I’ve taken away is that people feel very ‘seen’ by it,” says Pancho. By this she means the ballet world is acknowledging that not all dancers are white. “A lot of people who didn’t become dancers for various reasons have said, ‘If only this had existed in my day.’” There has been online trolling, too. Of the “We’ve fed you, clothed you, educated you and now you want pointe shoes in your own skin colour!” variety, says Pancho. “I don’t follow it up, but there’s definitely an undercurrent of, ‘Ballet is pink, it’s meant to be pink.’” That would be easily dismissed as internet nonsense if it wasn’t for the fact that some people in the industry see no place for black dancers in the traditional corps de ballet. When Benjamin Millepied resigned as director of the Paris Opera Ballet in 2016, he spoke of hearing a colleague say black dancers were a “distraction”. The new shoes have put the issue back on the agenda. “This has really sparked something,” says Pancho, “which is a testament to the fact that it is really important that we keep talking about race – even though it’s uncomfortable.” She thinks people get too caught up in worrying about terminology (Pancho is still criticised for the name of her company, 18 years after it was founded) and it often shuts down conversation. “It’s so easy to go down a path of being offended,” she says. “Sometimes you have to push through that to talk about the actual issue, which in our case is the lack of black women in ballet.” In their own small way, these shoes should go some way to changing that. • Ballet Black are touring the UK until June.",Stage
"Row over bid to extend centenary events to cover Ireland and India Members of the government’s advisory board on the first world war centenary are at loggerheads over extending the commemorations to mark politically challenging events such as the Irish war of independence and Britain’s slaughter of peaceful protesters in India. The group, set up under David Cameron, advised on four years of commemorations ranging from traditional events at the Cenotaph to beachside tributes conceived by the director Danny Boyle. Some members have been pressing to extend the official commemorations to address thorny issues such as the 1919-21 war in Ireland and the role of British forces including the violent police auxiliary force known as the Black and Tans, as well as the 100th anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar in 1919. “It’s a missed opportunity,” said Hew Strachan, one of a number of historians who sits on the committee along with former military chiefs and authors such as Sebastian Faulks and Pat Barker. “A number of people felt that we should take in the whole complicated process of establishing peace, and that obviously includes Ireland and why the peace settlements were so hard to impose.” Despite the relative success of the commemorations, it also appears that the first world war is still regarded by the government as a political hot potato. A freedom of information request by the Guardian for minutes of the advisory board was rejected owing to fears they could prejudice relations with other states involved in the war. A letter from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: “The UK’s relationship with many of the states involved in the war are of vital importance. A strained relationship would be likely to result in a breakdown of trust and communications between the parties.” Another committee member, the Liberal Democrat peer Sir Menzies Campbell, said it had been talking about how to build on a new “greater understanding” of the first world war among younger people. “But there is a debate – and it still has to be resolved – about you then go on to consider the Versailles treaty and its consequences and of course arising out of that the Irish question and matters of that kind,” he said. “There are some very interesting questions: was Versailles rubbing the noses of the Germans in the dirt with all the terrible consequences that came with it? There is also the role of the Black and Tans in Ireland who were largely composed of former soldiers who had fought for king and country.” The committee has yet to hold a final meeting but one member told the Guardian initial suggestions that more challenging post-1918 events should be marked were “effectively blocked” by the chair. “We were told: ‘We’re not going there.’” Deian Hopkin, a member of the advisory board and expert adviser to the first minister of Wales for the centenary, said it was important to mark the coming of peace but also to question: ‘What kind of peace was this?’ “On the first Remembrance Day in 1919 for example a number of servicemen refused to turn up on the grounds that they were not being treated properly. They wanted jobs, houses, a better life, rather than memorials,” he said. “In fact, throughout 1919 there were mutinies in the armed forces and in August 1919, there were even race riots in Cardiff when black seamen were attacked. Thinking of what’s going on at the moment we must not forget events such as these. It all reminds us that there is nothing new in history and we still have many lessons to learn.” Andrew Murrison, a Tory MP on the board, who was appointed by Cameron as his special representative for the remembrance, said of continuing commemorations: “My advice would be to be led by public demand. Over a period like this we have certainly been informed by the desire of the public. “In general in relation to historical events I think it’s important that the UK government and embassies overseas are sensitive to the needs and aspirations of hosts and other countries.” Lord Ashton, the minister for the commemorations, acknowledged last week to a Westminster committee that there had been criticism that official events did not go beyond 2018, but said many events were being supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and by other sources to address Versailles and other moments. A DCMS spokesperson said: “The First World War Advisory Group was set up to provide strategic oversight and advise the Secretary of State on the four year period of commemorations. From the start we were clear this would end with the anniversary of signing the Armistice in 2018.”",World news
"Butterfly numbers fall by 84% in Netherlands over 130 years – study Butterflies have declined by at least 84% in the Netherlands over the last 130 years, according to a study, confirming the crisis affecting insect populations in western Europe. Researchers analysed 120,000 butterflies caught by collectors between 1890 and 1980 as well as more recent scientific data from more than 2 million sightings to identify dramatic declines in the country’s 71 native butterfly species, 15 of which have become extinct over the last century. “We are quite sure that the real decline must be much larger,” said Chris van Swaay, of Dutch Butterfly Conservation and one of the co-authors of the study. The research follows warnings of catastrophic insect declines after a global review calculated that the total mass of insects was falling by 2.5% each year, and a German study found average flying insect abundance had declined by 76% over 27 years. Since the scientific monitoring of British butterflies began in 1976, there has been a 77% decline in “habitat specialists”, which are found only in certain areas, such as woodland or chalk grassland, while populations of more common species found across the countryside have fallen by 46%. Although no British species have become extinct since 1979, conservationists are concerned about the potential disappearance of once-abundant species’, including the small tortoiseshell (down 75%) and the white-letter hairstreak (93% since the 1970s). Measurements of declines in wildlife usually begin from when the collection of scientific data began in the 1970s but Van Swaay said their study showed the dangers of “shifting baseline syndrome”, where declines are only identified from a point where species are already extremely depleted. Historic collections point to a drastic decline in butterflies before “scientific” measuring began, although Van Swaay said even those old collections did not fully reveal the dramatic declines because common species of butterfly were not sought out by collectors. According to Van Swaay, the main reason for the declines in the Netherlands was modern industrial farming – as carried out across the lowlands of western Europe – which left little space for nature. “Before 1950 or so, grasslands in the Netherlands very much resembled what we now only have left in some nature reserves – they were wet, they had lots of flowers, were lightly grazed and mown only once or twice a year. This was very low-intensity farming. “In two decades after the 1950s, the countryside was rebuilt – land was drained and planted with one species of grass, large amounts of fertiliser was put on the land, and it was mown six times a year. There is no room for butterflies except on road verges and nature reserves. The countryside is more or less empty.” Species to have vanished entirely from the Netherlands include the marsh fritillary, the black-veined white and the large blue. “We made a bigger mess of it [than Britain],” said Van Swaay. Over a similar period in Britain, five species became extinct but one, the large blue, had been successfully reintroduced using caterpillars from Sweden. The Netherlands held on to one species, the large copper, which became extinct in Britain. According to Van Swaay, the number of large coppers had increased in recent years because global warming had helped the butterfly, which is at the northerly limit of its natural range. Similarly, wood-edge butterflies, such as the purple emperor and silver-washed fritillary, were expanding their range in the Netherlands because of bothwarming and a revival in traditional woodland management, such as coppicing, which lets sunlight into woodlands. Both species are also doing well in Britain. According to Van Swaay, the study, published in Biological Conservation, confirms that “industrial agriculture is simply leaving hardly any room for nature” across the EU and in developed nations such as the US. He said: “These are butterflies which are easy to see but this will also be happening to all kinds of other insects and animal life in the soil. It’s also happening to farmland birds who eat insects. It goes all the way up the chain from insects to birds to predators.” Over the next two years, the EU must devise a new common agricultural policy, which conservationists say has contradictory incentives to both destroy and enhance wildlife. Van Swaay said: “There are big farm organisations who want to continue with how they have done it so far, but there is a growing group of farmers who want a different view on this, and there are politicians who want to change to a Europe with more room for nature and biodiversity.”",Environment
"Mauro Icardi's 40 days in wilderness end with rejection not redemption Inter were poised, at last, to put this season’s most disruptive soap opera behind them. Mauro Icardi had returned to first-team training on Tuesday, ending a 40-day absence that began when he was stripped of the club captaincy. It felt like an opportune moment: spirits were high following a win over Milan, and half the squad was away on international duty, including colleagues with whom he had clashed. The striker appeared to reintegrate smoothly. News outlets circulated videos of him passing the ball to Ivan Perisic – his purported personal rival – during a practice match. Marcelo Brozovic, who made headlines last month by ‘liking’ the Instagram post which announced that Icardi had been stripped of the captaincy, now did the same for one reporting the Argentinian’s return to the fold. It was a stretch to imagine that every wounded relationship was fully healed. At the very least, though, it appeared Inter were ready to come together and put their focus on qualifying for the Champions League. That derby win had moved them back up to third, and created a six-point buffer to Roma in fifth place. But then Lautaro Martínez injured his thigh on international duty. He would miss the weekend’s game against Lazio. The common assumption was that this might accelerate Icardi’s return to the side – leaving Inter with no other natural centre-forwards to choose from. Luciano Spalletti went in a different direction. Instead of rushing Icardi back, he left the player out of his matchday squad altogether. Inter lined up with Keita Baldé in the centre of attack: just as they had against Eintracht Frankfurt on the last occasion when both Icardi and Lautaro were missing. They slumped to an identical 1-0 defeat. Lazio deserve credit for weathering an early spell of Inter pressure and then responding – as they often have under Simone Inzaghi – with ruthless counter-attacking play. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has been criticised for failing to deliver in big games before now, but helped initiate a move in his own half that ended with him rising above Brozovic to head home inside the Inter six-yard box. Icardi watched from the stands as Spalletti worked through a series of ineffective substitutions, culminating in the 84th minute replacement of Keita with João Mário – a midfielder. The manager had backed himself into a corner, his only other option being the 19-year-old youth team player Facundo Colidio: yet to make his senior debut. If the decision to omit Icardi from the matchday squad was bemusing, then Spalletti’s post-game comments only made it worse. “He has to sit out today for how he has behaved,” said the manager. “You say he could have played 10 minutes, could have played 20 minutes. I think he could even have played a full half … But you have to be inside a changing room, you have to have credibility. I’ve had credibility with my players for 22 years. You’re not the ones who get to write my history. It’s the players I’ve shared a changing room with. Not you.” Fans may share Spalletti’s anger at how Inter were made to negotiate through a lawyer – Paolo Nicoletti – just to get Icardi back to training in the first place. “What am I to do from here going forward?” he posed. “Should I send 20 letters out asking the players’ legal representatives whether I can call them up or not?” But what do such words accomplish? Icardi has weathered plenty of public criticism, so it hardly seems plausible that this outburst would set him on the road to contrition. All Spalletti actually achieved was to put himself at the centre of the story. Rather than take responsibility for a limp performance, he simply sought to play the victim: as he does dispiritingly often. Even the attempt to represent Icardi’s exclusion as a hard stance against disrespectful behaviour was made to look false as he went on to suggest that the player could feature against Genoa on Wednesday. Spalletti did not indicate that any act of penitence would be required between now and then. The only saving grace for Inter is that they remain in pole position among the pack of teams battling for third and fourth place. Milan lost away to Sampdoria on Saturday, courtesy of a goal gifted to their opponents in the very first minute – when Gianluigi Donnarumma passed the ball directly to Grégoire Defrel. Roma then crashed to a humiliating 4-1 defeat at home to Napoli. If anything, that scoreline flattered them. Claudio Ranieri confessed afterward that he had “no idea” how his team had made it to half-time at 1-1, scoring from a penalty just before the interval. Roma were missing Alessandro Florenzi and Stephan El Shaarawy, both of whom picked up injuries on international duty, but that could not excuse such disarray. By full-time, media outlets in Rome were calling for the return of Eusebio Di Francesco as manager. This was Ranieri’s second defeat in three games, with the previous loss coming against relegation battlers Spal. At least on this occasion there were no reports of players coming to blows at half-time, as El Shaarawy and Edin Dzeko did back then. Ranieri is not to blame for the mess Roma find themselves in. Di Francesco’s tenure ended last month with a 3-0 defeat to Lazio followed by the 3-1 loss to Porto that knocked his team out of the Champions League. The problems here run deeper: to a club stuck in limbo as it waits for final approval to develop its new stadium, to the muddled transfer strategy led by Monchi, and perhaps to a void in leadership since he departed. Before kick-off on Sunday, Francesco Totti reflected on his own directorial role, saying: “Let’s see if, from now on, I carry more weight in decision-making.” He was influential in the decision to bring in Ranieri as a short-term caretaker. A summer of upheaval beckons, with the likes of Dzeko and Kostas Manolas expected to move on and no clarity yet on whether Daniele De Rossi, who turns 36 in July, will want to carry on for another year. Missing out on the Champions League would make things an awful lot harder.

"It’s time for common sense on Brexit – a customs union must prevail MPs can vote today to honour both the referendum and common sense. They can vote to leave the EU and stay in the European customs union. That they are faced with much the same range of options as last week is inexcusable. Why could they not get together over the weekend, and agree a soft Brexit compromise? Now they must redeem themselves. The votes should be free and unwhipped. The Speaker should plead for it. The whips should grant it. The chief government whip, Julian Smith, has admitted an “unprecedented” collapse in discipline, but we are where we are. The nation is screaming for unity and resolution – employers, unions, industries big and small, opinion polls, every non-maverick lobby in the land. The Westminster bubble must burst. Even hard Brexiters have accepted that economic pain will come with a no-deal Brexit. For what gain? They persist in claiming that “reaching trade deals with the rest of the world” is a plausible alternative to a customs union with Europe. There is no shred of evidence for this. Yet they are ready to damage the economy, bring down their leader and possibly split their party. They lost the argument for no-deal Brexit. They have fallen back on blind tribal xenophobia. If, as seems likely, parliament votes for a customs union tonight, this will apparently lead to a specific demand that Theresa May return to Brussels with that proposal, possibly with an additional promise for a confirmatory referendum on her return. That referendum, too, is on tonight’s order paper. So far, her stubbornness has gone beyond all reason. She should, as Smith said, have leaned towards soft Brexit from the start. Now she must pay the price for that failure. She must obey the Commons as her final gesture before resigning. She will at least have delivered Brexit. The real Brexit debate is what it should have been from the start, between simple customs union and the wider alignments, notably of migration, involved in the single European market. Remaining in the single market makes every kind of sense, but its migration provisions lie at the core of the referendum outcome. A customs union alone may be the wisest basis to go forward into the transition. Even this seems likely to split May’s cabinet and party in parliament. It means she or her successor will need to rely on a cross-party agreement during further EU talks. So be it. May will be accused of repeating Robert Peel’s split in 1846 over the corn laws. She should remember that Peel faced down his backwoodsmen and created a Conservative party fit for the Victorian age. He was in the right. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",Opinion
"Brexit is turning Britain into a laughing stock, says Siemens UK boss The UK chief executive of the German manufacturing group Siemens has said Brexit is making Britain an international “laughing stock”, while urging MPs to pursue a softer withdrawal from the EU. Jürgen Maier said Britain was wrecking its reputation for business stability, putting investment in the country at risk and threatening the economy. A no-deal Brexit would inflict further damage, he said, while urging MPs to reach a consensus and back a customs union with the EU. Writing an open letter to MPs published by the Politico website, he said: “The world is watching, and where the UK used to be beacon for stability, we are now becoming a laughing stock. “Enough is enough. We are all running out of patience. Make a decision and unite around a customs union compromise that delivers economic security and stability.” The head of Siemens UK, which is one of the country’s biggest industrial firms with annual revenues of £5bn and 15,000 staff, said political turmoil over Brexit was making it harder for him to win support for British investment from the firm’s managing board in Germany. The warning came after official figures showed business investment slumped last year, declining in every quarter for the first time since the last recession in 2008, as companies put spending decisions on hold due to the lack of clarity over the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU. Business leaders have become increasingly exasperated with MPs’ inability to break the deadlock over Brexit in parliament, reacting with frustration after Theresa May’s plan was defeated for a third time on Friday. Maier has previously said Siemens UK was ramping up stocks of critical supplies because of Brexit, stocking more components required for machines used to keep the country running, including on infrastructure such as railways and food processing. The Anglo-Austrian businessman has developed a reputation in recent years as one of the most outspoken captains of industry in Britain, debating politics on television programmes such as Question Time when other business leaders would shy away. He campaigned for remain before the EU referendum but backed the prime minister’s deal, saying it would provide certainty for businesses and avoid the UK crashing out without an agreement. However, he said the current approach had failed and called on the government to compromise with MPs. He said he believed a majority would most likely be found through a UK-EU customs union, which was among the options closest to winning support last week when MPs voted on eight separate proposals for breaking the impasse. Such an outcome would enable the continuation of frictionless trade with the EU and save businesses billions of pounds every year on unproductive customs declarations, he said.",Politics
"Seven-year-old boy was electrocuted in east London pub garden, say police Police have interviewed two men in their 70s under caution in relation to the death of a seven-year-old boy in Romford. Harvey Tyrrell, from Harold Wood, was said by witnesses to have died when he fell and hit his head while climbing over a pub wall on 11 September last year, according to reports at the time. A JustGiving page set up to raise funds for his funeral described his death as a “tragic accident”. However, on Monday, the Metropolitan police said the cause of Harvey’s death had been confirmed as electrocution and they had passed a file on the incident to prosecutors. They said a 70-year-old man was interviewed under caution on 12 September 2018 and a 72-year-old man was interviewed under caution on 11 January. Police were called by the London ambulance service to the King Harold pub in Station Road, Romford, shortly after 5.20pm on 11 September last year. He had been playing in the pub’s beer garden. Harvey was found unresponsive and was taken to an east London hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.33pm. Police said a special postmortem was carried out on 13 September at St Thomas’ Hospital, central London. An inquest into his death was opened and adjourned at Walthamstow coroner’s court on 21 September. The inquest heard from a witness that Harvey stood on a garden light and and grabbed a railing above his head, and then appeared to “tighten up” and “straightened up” before letting go, the Romford Recorder reported. A parent who was supervising told the coroner that when Harvey grabbed the railing he had felt an electrical surge. The JustGiving page, which raised more than £25,000, described Harvey as “a beautiful, happy and healthy seven-year-old boy who loved his football just like any other boy his age”. It said his family were left heartbroken by his death. Hundreds of tributes were left to Harvey on the JustGiving page. Jan Willett wrote: “Sending much love to Harvey’s family. Harvey was such a cheerful happy little boy and I feel privileged that I knew him during his time at HWPS [Harold Wood primary school]. Sleep peacefully Harvey.” His football club, Harold Wood Cougars, described him as a talented member of its under-eights team. As a sign of respect it cancelled all junior football matches the weekend after his death, while the senior team wore black armbands and held a minute’s silence. Harold Wood primary school, where he had just started in year three, described him as “a delightful member of the school” who would be missed by everyone.",UK news
"Worcester appoint new kicking coach for next season ... or do they? Worcester have made the unusual and intriguing decision to appoint the former Premier League manager Ian Holloway as their new kicking coach, but not all is as it seems. The Premiership side made the announcement as an April Fool’s joke, at least that’s what we must assume, as Holloway has zero experience with the oval ball but is well-known for his cheeky nature, so is naturally more than happy to throw a dummy to supporters. “I’ve watched a lot of rugby and always thought I’d be able to help with the kicking side of the game so when the opportunity arose to join Warriors, I jumped at the chance,” Holloway joked. “There are a lot of similarities between rugby and football and I believe a clever kicking game can really help a side in open play so that will be a big focus of mine. “There are some really talented players at the club and I’m looking forward to getting started in the summer.” In Holloway’s natural habitat, Premier League teams Watford and Fulham both came up with the idea of kit adjustments to see if they could get fans on board with their quirky ideas. The Hornets “confirmed” their new kit for next season following reported (fictional) leaks of the vibrant ensemble. The lattice design on the shirts includes four colours: yellow, red, black and white, which would have been a bold statement at the best of times, even if it is a joke. White shorts are incorporated, too, in order to end the fan debate between whether the club should wear red or black around their midriff. “Vividly using the club’s primary three colours, a striking lattice design pays homage to what will be the Golden Boys’ 13th season in the top-flight, with each coloured diamond representing an individual campaign throughout our history,” the statement claimed. “The shirt has been created using a revolutionary meshed fibre that regulates body temperature and controls sweating, meaning each player need only worry about their performance on the pitch. Lightweight and machine washable, the strip fully embodies the club’s values of empowerment, togetherness and diversity in stunning fashion.” A slightly lighter touch was offered by Fulham, who created the concept of all team shirts having double-digit squad numbers, meaning Ryan Sessegnon would wear ‘03’ on his back from now on, for example. It is probably an idea which has been debate at clubs in order to add a couple more quid to the cost of shirts.",Sport
"Rees-Mogg defends promotion of German far-right AfD video Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended his decision to tweet a video of a speech by a senior member of Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), saying he did not endorse the party’s views but the opinions expressed had “real importance”. The Conservative backbencher and leading Brexiter faced strong criticism from some Labour MPs after tweeting a YouTube video of a speech by Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD’s 91 deputies in the Bundestag, the German parliament. Rees-Mogg added the message: “The AfD leader asks: ‘Is it any wonder the British see bad faith behind every manoeuvre from Brussels?’” While the AfD began as an anti-euro campaign force, it has shifted its focus to immigration and Islam. Last year, an AfD poster for elections in Bavaria showed light-skinned teenagers running down a corridor with the slogan: “Islam-free schools”. The Labour MP David Lammy said Rees-Mogg was “promoting Germany’s overtly racist party”. He tweeted: “Our country’s proudest moment was defeating the far right. Now we are supposed to sit back while xenophobes, nativists, nationalists and isolationists do their best to tear Europe apart again. We must not let them win.” His Labour colleague Stella Creasy tweeted: “We have to deal with the AfD on the Council of Europe. One of their reps claims that ‘Muslims in Europe are seeking to kill all Germans’. So forgive us @Jacob_Rees_Mogg if don’t use them as you do as a metric for decent opinions by which we should be influenced.” Asked about the criticism during a phone-in on LBC radio, Rees-Mogg said he was not endorsing the party. “No, no, I’m not supporting the AfD,” he said. “But this is a speech made in the Bundestag of real importance because it shows a German view of Brexit and it’s saying to the Germans: ‘Look, you’re paying for this, you’re going to pay more for this’, and Angela Merkel has tied herself up in knots with the French to the disadvantage of the Germans. “And I think it’s important people know this is a strand of German political thinking. I don’t think retweeting is an endorsement of things that other people stand for. It’s just pointing out that there’s something interesting that is worth watching.” In the speech, Weidel said the German chancellor was partly responsible for Brexit by showing too little flexibility when David Cameron was trying to reform the EU, and said Merkel should help the UK stay in the single market. The clip tweeted by Rees-Mogg came from a YouTube channel that specialises in material from far-right European politicians, such as the French National Rally politician Marion Maréchal and Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini. Other videos on the channel condemn feminism and criticise the BBC for promoting racial diversity.",Politics
"'Reasserting white power': behind the psychosis that gave rise to blackface It’s 1830. You’re a poor Irish immigrant living in New York’s infamous Five Points slums. Penniless and uneducated, you’re viewed by affluent white society as every bit as inferior as the blacks you live among in overcrowded squalor. As best as you can tell, you’ll never gain an ounce of status or wealth unless you can win the social acceptance of the Anglo elites. How do you convince them you’re white – a racial category that was still new and, they hoped, malleable – like them? Paint yourself black, of course. “They are using blackface as a way of saying to white Protestant New Yorkers and other people in the urban settings, ‘We’re as good as you, we’re white like you – we’re making fun of black folks, that makes us white like you,’” historian John Strausbaugh told me. In his 2006 book Black Like You, Strausbaugh traces the roots of blackface minstrelsy to New York’s Bowery Theatre and young Irish performers darkening their skin in comic imitations of blacks on plantations. Strausbaugh wrote: “It was simple and rough, with a tune that was easy to remember and a good beat. It was funny and perhaps more important, it was rude and in bad taste.” Blackface minstrelsy of the 1820s and 30s emerged as a rejection of the stodgy, uptight European music that dominated at the time. Its popularity was born in part out of the surface appeal of these up-tempo jigs and the irreverent performance, but it was also owed to a deeper and messier psychological hold. “It always has had a dominant aspect of mocking black folks,” Strausbaugh said. “But there’s love and hate, there’s admiration and mockery.” The New York slums where Irish and blacks lived is where blackface is thought to have first taken hold. It was hardly kumbaya – take the anti-abolition riots of 1834 as a case and point – but it was, by most historical accounts, the first neighborhood-wide example of voluntary racial integration in American history. Blackface minstrelsy was born in this crucible, and similar to later forms like jazz and rock’n’roll, came to occupy the tangled space between black music and the white mimicry – however lamentable – of black music. Even as those new cultural phenomena emerged, blackface would remain a part of the American cultural zeitgeist right through the present. Some things would change, others wouldn’t. On the one hand, any complex notions of cultural admiration would be thoroughly excised after the civil war, as blackface devolved into abject, uncomplicated racist propaganda. On the other hand, blackface minstrelsy’s appeal as an outlet of lowbrow, salacious youth culture is a strand that followed it through to modern day, where it’s still invoked as spoof on college campuses and Halloween parties. This was drawn in stark terms when, in January, Virginia governor Ralph Northam was engulfed in scandal from a decades-old blackface image in his 1984 medical school yearbook. He wasn’t alone. A USA Today survey of some 900 yearbooks from around the country found that the late 1970s and 1980s saw a wave of blackface creep into white American youth culture, especially at college parties and among fraternities. Why? Strausbaugh points to the fact that by late 1960s into the 1970s was a period of broad and intentional movement at colleges and universities to diversify the student body and on-campus programming. It was the start of affirmative action, new departments in ethnic and gender studies began to pop up coast to coast. Universities were becoming less and less the repositories of classic literature and history for the elite, and instead, bastions of subversive and progressive ideology. “By the 1980s, you had to know that blackface was taboo, that it was an insult and an outrage,” said Strausbaugh. “You were doing it on purpose to be outrageous and to make a statement which was: ‘we feel threatened on our campus that used to be an exclusively white preserve.’” The 1980s is the reaction point, where, fueled by the conservative “Reagan revolution” white students start pushing back against this perceived encroachment. “In this fantasy narrative of white loss, blackface becomes a way of reasserting white power,” said David Leonard, a professor of comparative ethnic studies and American studies at Washington University. “Whether it’s affirmative action threatening white futures or political correctness – this becomes a response to each of those kinds of imagined assaults on whiteness. “It becomes a way of reasserting the power to, quote-unquote, ‘do whatever we want’.” In the 1840s and 50s, blackface minstrelsy was a dominant theatre act across the US. On the back of his massive song/dance hit called Jump Jim Crow, a man named Thomas Rice would become the form’s first superstar. Strausbaugh compares his emergence to what Elvis would later mean for rock’n’roll. The character he performed – a limping, shuffling old black field-hand in jet black grease paint made from burnt cork – would ossify as the archetypal blackface minstrel. The name Jim Crow would of course, become immortalized as the informal nickname for the system of apartheid segregation that would emerge in the US after the civil war. It was fitting. By the late 1800s, blackface minstrelsy had become almost entirely a vehicle of anti-black propaganda, broadcasting blacks as buffoonish, untrustworthy oafs to white Americans who, in many cases, had no other exposure to black people. “Alongside everything else going on in the country after Reconstruction, it becomes much uglier, much harder, much more brutally anti-black than it had been in its fairly early years,” Strausbaugh said. Blackface (though not minstrelsy, per se) would reach its pinnacle as racist propaganda in 1915 with the release of DW Griffith’s Birth of a Nation, which used white actors in blackface to depict freed blacks as animalistic rapists to such effect that it helped spawn a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. “It was an exhibition of power,” Leonard said, “the power to become this other, to become that which is mockable, that which is not fully human. And if you can become this other not fully human, this uncivilized, then that reinforces what you are – all the opposites, civilized, human, desirable.” The form would undergo one last tonal shift at the onset of the jazz age. Like the Irish before them, nominally white Jewish performers began blacking up to sing and dance in mimicry of black artists, for arguably many of the same reasons as a century earlier. “It became a way of proving one’s whiteness because, if one was becoming black through blackface then you weren’t black,” Leonard said. Far less explicitly white supremacist than in the immediate fall of Reconstruction, the jazz age revival was nevertheless set to the tone of a kind of plantation nostalgia with all of the racist implications of a “time when darkies knew their place”. But it was, thankfully, the end of an era. By the civil rights movement, white Americans had been all but shamed out of blackface performance in professional entertainment settings. Cue its re-emergence as a derisive embrace of forbidden tropes among groups of white students on college campuses. It’s a trend that has survived beyond Northam and the 1980s to today, and one Strausbaugh says not to expect an end to anytime soon. “Folklorists, say that the lore cycles back as long as the conditions that created it in the first place haven’t changed that much, and that’s what we’re seeing,” said Strausbaugh. “As long as the American psychosis about race is still embedded in the culture, which it clearly is, then things like blackface are going to keep reappearing.”",World news
"She invented a birth control app – with some unintended consequences In an air-starved meeting room in Manhattan’s Financial District, heavily pregnant particle physicist Elina Berglund, 35, is explaining how she inadvertently went from the cutting edge of scientific discovery to the frontline of birth control. In spring 2012, the Swedish scientist was working in Geneva at Cern, where she was part of the team looking for the Higgs boson particle (the finding would later win the Nobel prize). It was then that she started looking for a natural alternative to hormonal contraceptives. Pointing to the three little scars on her upper arm from where her implant sat for 10 years, Berglund remembers not wanting to get another one. “I was thinking: ‘OK, I want to have kids in a few years, so what can I do to bridge this gap?’ I felt like maybe it was a good time to let my body get back to ovulating again and get back to normal before I wanted to get pregnant.” To bypass the implant while still controlling her fertility, she built an algorithm which analysed her lowest resting temperature each day to determine whether or not she could become pregnant (women’s basal body temperature rises after ovulation). Soon, her colleagues wanted to try it. While on their honeymoon, her husband, Raoul Scherwitzl, who is also a physicist, suggested turning the algorithm into an app. She quickly saw the appeal: “I could see that so many women would benefit from it.” Today their app, Natural Cycles, has more than a million registered users worldwide, $37.5m in investment and 95 employees globally. It’s the first app to be certified as a contraceptive in Europe and cleared by the FDA to be marketed as birth control in the US, where it officially launched this March for $9.99 a month. At nine months pregnant with her second child, Berglund says the app has worked successfully for her as both a contraceptive and in conceiving. “I’m a person who really likes to plan and optimise. I like to say exactly what month I want to get pregnant.” As a contraceptive, the app claims to be 93% effective with “typical use” and 98% effective with “perfect use”. This compares with 85% typical and 98% perfect for condoms, or 91% typical and 99% perfect for the pill, according to Planned Parenthood figures. But last year, Natural Cycles’ effectiveness came under public scrutiny. In January 2018, the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) ran a widely publicised investigation after Södersjukhuset hospital in Stockholm reported that 37 Natural Cycles users had abortions in a four-month period. The MPA later confirmed that the pregnancies were in fact in line with the product’s failure rate, but asked the company to “clarify the risk of unwanted pregnancies” in the instructions and app. In retrospect, Berglund says it is “not so strange that they raised this alarm because it was 37 pregnancies out of 668 and of course if there’s a new product … However, what was a little bit strange was that they also went out with a press release about it.” She says she also found their decision to include typical use failures unusual. In August, the Advertising Standards Authority in Britain ruled that a 2017 Facebook ad for Natural Cycles that included the phrases “highly accurate” and “clinically tested” was misleading. This, Berglund admits, was a mistake: “It makes no sense to talk about accuracy when it comes to contraception, you talk about effectiveness, so I think they’re completely right about that.” When I ask about how she handles unwanted pregnancies of users personally, she seems genuinely stricken. “This is really the downside of working with contraception, that it will never succeed to 100%, so there will always be these failure rates. And these 37 women is not the first time I’ve dealt with unwanted pregnancy from Natural Cycles. We try to follow up with our users on a monthly basis and I …” she takes a deep breath in. Through an exhale, she continues: “It’s always very hard. You want to do something good and then you have a woman contacting you because it failed for her, it’s super tough.” Users are encouraged to check their temperature at least five days a week as soon as they wake up and enter their information into the app to find out whether they’re on a “green” (not fertile) or “red” (fertile) day. It also has “plan a pregnancy” mode. The most common reason for unwanted pregnancies, Berglund says, is people not using protection on red days. If people used it perfectly and only on green days, she says the failure rate would be 0.5% (the 98% “perfect use” effectiveness rate takes into account condom failure). The reason it is not 100% effective, she explains, is because sometimes the body suddenly ovulates early, or there is a temperature rise that looks like ovulation but isn’t. “My dream is if we could have a chip in the body that measures all hormones directly,” she says, somewhat optimistically. While it is almost possible on an academic level, she explains, it’s by no means imminent from a consumer perspective. For now, though, her focus is on the US, where she says they plan to learn from their experiences in Europe. Berglund and her husband relocated from Stockholm to New York in September. So far, the response has been positive – from both the medical community and users. But of course, the birth control arena in the US comes with its own unique politics. Women’s healthcare in America is a key political battleground for the Trump administration. It recently announced it will stop organisations that refer people for abortions from receiving government funding and has attempted to restrict access to contraception. “As a European scientist I’m of course more pro giving the women as much option as possible and letting them choose. I think that’s more the right thing to do,” says Berglund, who describes herself as pro-choice. But with Natural Cycles already working with Title X – a government scheme that funds reproductive healthcare to low-income Americans – to give free access to underprivileged women in New Hampshire, it seems that whether or not Berglund intends to, getting caught up in politics may be unavoidable. How would she feel if her app was used by the Trump administration to disempower women by restricting access to other birth control methods? “Well, I haven’t seen that happening yet. If it would I would of course fight that. But not yet.” The company does not, she says, share personal data. Berglund says many pharmaceutical companies are cutting funding for women’s health. She hopes that the booming femtech industry (predicted to be valued at $50bn by 2025) will be able to step in to fill it with more products by and for women. And what about birth control solutions for men? Berglund plans to stick to women’s health for now, but hopes to see more male options in the future. Men, she says, have been resistant to putting up with the kinds of side-effects that women experience from hormonal contraception in studies, which doesn’t encourage research. “I think that’s very sad because, you know … why do we have to deal with it?” Having worked in two typically male-dominated industries, physics and tech, Berglund says she has been lucky to work among women (Natural Cycles’ staff is 65% female and 35% male.) She believes making those subjects more appealing to women in some circumstances could be as simple as reframing it. Women, she says, are often more interested in programming as a means to an end, whereas men are more often interested in the technology itself. Her daughter Alba, who is four, is already showing an interest in nature and the universe. When she is five, Berglund says she might start teaching her about coding.",Life and style
"Poem of the week: A dialogue in praise of the owl and the cuckoo by William Shakespeare Spring When daisies pied and violets blue And lady-smocks all silver-white And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue Do paint the meadows with delight, The cuckoo then, on every tree, Mocks married men; for thus sings he: “Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear, Unpleasing to a married ear! When shepherds pipe on oaten straws, And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks, When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws, And maidens bleach their summer smocks, The cuckoo then, on every tree, Mocks married men; for thus sings he, “Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear, Unpleasing to a married ear! Winter When icicles hang by the wall, And Dick the shepherd blows his nail, And Tom bears logs into the hall, And milk comes frozen home in pail; When blood is nipped, and ways be foul, Then nightly sings the staring owl, “Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” – A merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. When all aloud the wind doth blow, And coughing drowns the parson’s saw, And birds sit brooding in the snow, And Marian’s nose looks red and raw, When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, Then nightly sings the staring owl, “Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!”— A merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. These two songs are frequently anthologised and, for many readers, represent their first encounter with Shakespeare. Like many of the songs from the plays, Spring and Winter are so vivid and musical on the page, they read exquisitely as poems. Spring and Winter conclude the comedy, Love’s Labour’s Lost and are introduced by Armado (“a man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight”) as a “dialogue in praise of the owl and the cuckoo.” Armado then summons all the cast to join those already onstage, and divides them: “This side is Heims, Winter; this Ver, the Spring: the one maintained by the Owl, th’other by the Cuckoo. Ver, begin.” When the performance has finished, Armado announces, “The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo. You that way. We this way.” The delight of the two songs is that their apparent antithesis expresses a lack of opposition: each seems to look both ways, nimbly balancing the pleasures and disadvantages of their respective seasons. They mirror each other in form, with two stanzas in each song, with each stanza containing a bird-call refrain. Lightly handled iambic tetrameter ensures a skip to the beat. In the springtime of the play’s narrative, young King Ferdinand and his three attendant lords have vowed to renounce courtly pleasures for a three year period of study and abstinence. The arrival of the princess of France and her three ladies on a diplomatic mission have occasioned an immediate betrayal of the vow; erotic fun and games begin. But now mortality has entered Arcadia: the princess has learnt of the death of her father. So, at the end of the play, the expected romantic resolution is thwarted, because the death enforces a law against any nuptial celebrations for the period of a “twelvemonth and a day”. Now queen of France, the princess and her ladies set tests for their suitors, which will take a year and a day to complete, and which will reveal the men’s trustworthiness. As one of the young lords comments, “Our wooing doth not end like an old play: Jack hath not Jill.” Spring in the first song is bright and teeming, with its plethora of wild flowers named and delicately “painted” in the first stanza, and, in the second, piping shepherds, early-rising plowmen, laundry-happy maids, and birds in the full fluster of courtship. The pervasive threat of cuckoldry seems humorously exaggerated (“The cuckoo then on every tree / Mocks married men; for thus sings he: / ‘Cuckoo! …”). It strikes a low comic note as well as a faintly sour one. The winter song evokes homelier pleasures, absent from Arcadia. In changing season, it’s as if we’d changed location, from south to north. Dick the shepherd uses his breath not to pipe tunes, but to warm his fingers. The movement is nearly always from cold to warmth, in a “below-stairs” world where the servants are busily ensuring the creature comforts of their masters and mistresses. The crab apples are already hot, and “greasy Joan”, that most unforgettable of briefly depicted characters, is busy with some heartier fare. (To “keel the pot” is to stir the contents to prevent their boiling over.) To describe the owl’s call as “a merry note” is appropriate to the idea of the “dialogue” which requires contrast with the cuckoo’s mockery. Both, of course, are thoroughly anthropomorphic interpretations. Otherwise, the songs are grounded in a realism that lightly warns us against expecting more than nature itself can give, human nature included.",Books

There’s a real sense of time and place; a rising panic within the captive and the captors – usually young boys, paid poorly, and trapped and bound in the same underworld. A defining era for Colombia. High reportage from the mind of a novelist, and a tragedy told in heat and colour. Violent crime has also been fascinating safereturndoubtful, this time in Homicide: A Year On The Streets by David Simon: Simon spent a year with the Baltimore homicide division, one of the most violent cities in the country. The incidents encountered during the year are covered and of great interest, but the real strength and focus of the book is the study of the police detectives themselves, of the mechanisms they have of coping with what must be one of the most harrowing of jobs. It’s a long read, and won’t be for everyone, but those with a real interest in the TV series, and who might want to know more, it’s essential. Dodgers by Bill Beverly has impressed mgbellingham: A really interesting character study which put me in mind of Steinbeck throughout in Beverly’s descriptions of rural America. The cast list is relatively slight but they’re all so richly drawn and I was invested in all of them. Fat Walter provided a great comic foil to the brothers Ty and East who are rather tragic characters. East’s obsessive vigilance coupled with Ty’s psychopathic violent tendencies illicit a great deal of sympathy in the reader as you wonder at the lives these characters have lead which have made them as they are. The ending was slightly drawn out and anti-climactic but I did not resent spending a few more pages in East’s company. A coming of age tale with a grim realism at its heart, I loved it. “I’m a late-comer to Tara Westover’s Educated,” says kevinincanada “and found myself variously riveted, fuming and exasperated”: A memoir about a girl starting a formal education only at 16, but also getting an education in ‘life’. The core of the book is Westover’s descriptions of her very sheltered and abusive upbringing at the hands a dangerously religious father and complicit family. He’s blinkered, racist and brazenly hypocritical, as zealots often are, but Westover is nevertheless more forgiving of her father and than I would have been in her place. I had to keep reminding myself that this is now, not 70 years ago. In a similar vein to Hillbilly Elegy, it is difficult in places, but rewards the effort. Reedist has “just read” The Fountain Overflows trilogy by Rebecca West: Conventional in some ways, but very quickly un-put-downable for me... the frank descriptions of real poverty in this family that has ‘come down in the world’ through equally frankly-described fecklessness... the humour and resourcefulness of the family and their friends... and the very real characters, unexpected alliances etc.... also the serious attention given to art and the processes that go in to it. Somehow untypical of British writing, in a good way. According to LeoToadstool, The Longest Memory, by British-Guyanese writer Fred D’Aguiar, is “a modern classic of slavery literature”: Centred on the deadly flogging of a runaway slave and the aftermath, this is a poet’s novel in every sense of the word: an exquisitely-crafted, polyphonic cross-section of plantation life in early 19th century Virginia, accomplished in less than 150 pages. Reading it, I was put in mind of another slim, poetic slavery narrative, South African Wilma Stockenström’s The Expedition to the Baobab Tree, which is also highly recommended. Finally, Penelope Fitzgerald’s Human Voices has left MarGar65 in awe: How did she do this? How on earth could she accomplish in 200 pages the complexity that others go for and fail to achieve in much longer and convoluted narratives? She doesn’t waste a word, does she? She does not.

"Jeremy Corbyn needs to get behind the people’s vote to fight the far right For many in the Labour movement, the socialist, diverse left bloc of last week’s Put it to the People march may have felt more of a political home than, say, the main, continuity remain element – and that also highlights the big Jeremy Corbyn-shaped hole both at the event and in the wider campaign. For it actually to be more Corbyn left, the campaign would need the leadership’s buy-in (and the grassroots organising that would flow from that). Instead, it was down to the left bloc of Love Socialism Hate Brexit MPs and campaigners to present the radical left, anti-racist arguments for a second referendum. They did a great job, even though their message did not necessarily chime with everyone: one organiser told me they overhead someone at the main demo ask why the left bloc kept going on about socialism at an anti-Brexit march. This statement encapsulates the problem with a people’s vote campaign led by the centrist status quo that much of the leave vote was a protest against. Meanwhile, the anti-racist component of arguments over Brexit is too often ignored as we pore over the parliamentary politics of who might vote for which Brexit option and what happens next. Here we are with only bad choices, mounting chaos, reckless rhetoric, a terrible democratic failure and a febrile political climate, all of which is firing up a hate- and anger-filled far right already emboldened by Brexit. Whatever happens next, none of that is going away quickly. But one credible progressive case against a second referendum is that it will set this toxic cocktail alight, sparking a backlash against the far right’s usual targets: migrants and minorities. Implicit in this is an admission of defeat: that the left could not face down such an outcome, nor mount a defence of the communities on the receiving end of it. Looking at the left’s current configurations, it’s hard to argue with that. Among those at the political helm of the people’s vote campaign are advocates of immigration controls who exacerbated hostility towards migrants by invoking “legitimate concerns” over the pace of change. The Labour leadership, meanwhile, abandoned a commitment to freedom of movement, even though this would by definition mean increasingly hostile border policies. In January, the party sparked a backlash when it tried to abstain on a horrendous Tory immigration bill. Then there is the Lexit caucus, a component of which is currently echoing an antisemitic conspiracy beloved by the far right, while claiming that liberals are in cahoots with ethnic minorities to thwart the wishes of the (always implicitly white) working class. If you are a migrant or from a minority-ethnic community, which bit of this picture is supposed to provide reassurance that the left has your back? But this risks diminishing the strong BAME element of the people’s vote left bloc, at which half of Labour’s black MPs spoke. As Clive Lewis, the Corbyn-supporting Labour MP for Norwich South, said at the march: “There aren’t that many black MPs [in Labour] supporting Brexit … And do you know why? We’ve got a bit of a spider sense when it comes to shit like this. We could see that Brexit wasn’t going to end well for us.” These Labour MPs and campaigners are not ignoring the toxicity of a second vote, the racist foghorn it would unleash or the upsurge in racist abuse that could follow. They just appraise another vote as the best (or least worst) way of facing down the prejudice and bigotry that Brexit unleashed – and of facing down this rightwing, free-market fundamentalist project altogether. Some say that, whatever happens next, the far right is already emboldened. It feeds off victory, as it did when hate crime spiked after the first referendum. And it is fuelled by betrayal narratives, currently applied to soft Brexit, to Theresa May’s Brexit and to no Brexit at all. Hope not Hate activists report that, after years of canvassing in Ukip and BNP-supporting areas, they are taken aback by the open racism currently on display in leave constituencies. Barring an election, the only Brexit option that offers the opportunity to confront racism and express support for immigration is a second vote. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor and one of the speakers at Saturday’s left bloc, says she is already having these tough-but-necessary conversations, at a time when public awareness of the Brexit mess is acute. Campaigners have noted that the Labour grassroots is, on the whole, more vocally motivated than the leadership and could be mobilised into spreading the pro-migration message. For a second vote to stand a chance, it needs the socialist Labour leadership behind it, making it about transformational politics in Britain, rather than a default to a broken economic policy that is breaking people. But regardless of support for another referendum, with the far right permeating our political air supply, the Corbyn left must throw its intellectual, moral, campaigning and policymaking weight behind full-throated anti-racism and support for immigration. This is so long overdue, it’s starting to feel as if the left really has conceded defeat. • Rachel Shabi is a writer and regular broadcast news commentator",Opinion
"Would the UK be better off in or out of a customs union? Along with ending free movement of people, it was the reddest of Theresa May’s red lines: post-Brexit Britain should be able to strike its own trade deals. The prime minister contended that to respect the 2016 referendum result the UK must have “new opportunities to trade with the rest of the world” and, for the sake of these future trade deals, she ruled out Labour proposals for a permanent customs union with the EU. But the argument is far from over. A proposal for a permanent customs union with the EU fell just six votes short of a majority last week when MPs voted on their preferred Brexit outcome. For years a niche subject for campaigners, wonks and eurosceptics, trade policy has become a big issue in British political life. One former prime minister told a private audience recently that if he had been asked about the EU customs union during his time in office, he would not have known what they were talking about. The customs union means that EU countries apply the same tariffs to imported goods from the rest of the world. Trade deals are negotiated by Brussels on behalf of the (currently) 28 members, although governments agree the mandate and approve the final deal. The EU has trade deals covering 69 countries, including Canada and South Korea, which the UK is struggling to roll over to bilateral agreements. Proponents of an independent UK trade policy, such as the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, say Britain must forge its own deals if it is to take advantage of the world’s fast-growing economies. “Free to trade with the whole world” was one of the five promises of the Vote Leave manifesto of 2016. The government’s own forecasts show that a UK-US trade deal would boost the British economy by 0.2% in the long run, while deals with Asia – including China and India – the Gulf, Australia and New Zealand, would add up to 0.4%. Supporters of the UK striking its own trade deals have never explained why Germany manages to export more than three times the value in goods to China than Britain while also being in the EU customs union. Meanwhile, Japanese trade negotiators have said they will demand better terms from the UK than it gets from the EU, and Australia poured cold water on the UK’s hopes to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, due to its distant location. British scepticism of European trade policy has a long history. Arguments about New Zealand butter raged during the 1975 referendum. Eurosceptics on the right and left have blamed the European project for dumping cheap food on developing countries. Daniel Hannan, a long-term advocate of an independent trade policy, said he had not changed his mind. “The idea that we can’t improve the trade deals that we have through the EU is preposterous,” said the long-serving Conservative MEP. The UK would be able “to liberalise much further” in trade deals with the rest of the world, he said, rejecting suggestions that dropping tariffs could wipe out British manufacturing. “There has never been a country that has got poorer as a result of dropping its trade barriers.” Polls suggest the public like the idea of an independent trade policy, although few have been done. Almost half of people (49%) surveyed by Ipsos Mori in March 2018 thought the British economy would be better off in five to 10 years if the UK negotiated its own trade deals, even if that meant putting up barriers with Europe. In contrast, 36% favoured maintaining trade with the EU. Anthony Wells, the director of political research at YouGov, said: “If we ask people, they say they’d like Britain to be able to make its own trade deals, [but] I doubt it is really a driving force – it’s just an example of a wider concern. It is the principle of being able to make our own rules and laws that leave supporters care about.” A YouGov survey last July found that independent trade policy was voters’ joint fourth Brexit priority, behind control over immigration, and ending EU rules and budget payments. Trade experts say deals get more contentious once they become real. “It is one of those things that sounds great but when it actually comes down to it trade has always been controversial because people always want something from you,” said David Henig, who was heavily involved in negotiations on an EU-US trade deal. “New Zealand want to sell more lamb and Australia certainly want to sell us more lamb. That’s not going to go down very well in Wales or Scotland.” David Martin, a Labour MEP and senior member of the European parliament’s trade committee, said EU trade deals already lowered tariffs, opened up public procurement and ensured protection for speciality food and drink. “What is it that the advocates of an independent trade policy think an independent trade policy could deliver that the EU doesn’t?” He predicted resistance from MPs to a future UK-US trade deal if it would result in a flood of cheap American chicken and beef that undercut British farmers. “I am not sure that our farmers – and I know it is a bit cliched – want to throw their doors open to hormone beef from the United States … Because the volume of that beef could wipe out many of our farmers.” He predicted that, as a country of 66 million people facing much larger blocs, the UK would struggle to get its own way in trade talks. “The truth in trade negotiations is size really does matter.”",Politics
"US briefing: closing the border, Antifa and elections in Ukraine Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. ‘Only something dramatic’ will stop Trump shutting border Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has suggested it would take “something dramatic” for the president not to carry out his threat to close the US border with Mexico this week amid a spring surge of migrants from Central America, whose treatment in detainment has once more become a source of controversy. The Illinois Democratic senator Dick Durbin said that shutting border crossings, at the cost of billions in trade, was a “totally unrealistic” response. Aid cuts. The US state department announced over the weekend that it will cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, all countries that Trump has accused of deliberately sending migrants to the US.

Softer Brexit was ‘inevitable’, says May ally The UK government’s chief whip, Julian Smith, has told the BBC a soft Brexit became “inevitable” after Theresa May’s Conservatives lost their overall majority at the 2017 election. But all options remain on the table this week as parliament prepares for another round of indicative votes on alternatives to May’s Brexit deal, which she reportedly intends to bring to a vote for a fourth time. Cabinet rift. Several Brexiter cabinet members are reportedly threatening to resign if the prime minister backs a customs union with Europe, while pro-Europe members of May’s team say they would quit rather than support a no-deal Brexit. No laughing matter. John Harris says the English habit of approaching even serious subjects with heavy irony has left people complacent about the impending Brexit disaster. TV comedian leads in Ukrainian presidential election The actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who won fame in Ukraine for his portrayal of an ordinary schoolteacher who becomes president – has taken a big lead after the first round of the country’s real-life presidential elections. With just over half of the ballots counted early on Monday, Zelenskiy had 30.45%, while the incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, was in second place with 16.22%. Assuming neither claims an overall majority, the election will go to a runoff between the two men on 21 April. Turkey elections.

Intel report suggested leftwing protesters were ‘terrorists’ In the run-up to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, at which a neo-Nazi killed a counterprotester by driving a car into a crowd, law enforcement agencies received an intelligence report that appeared to endorse the notion that leftist protesters were “terrorists” just as responsible for street violence as white nationalists. The report, Antifa/Anti-antifa: Violence in the Streets, was produced by the Regional Organized Crime Information Center. ‘Anti-Antifa’? Experts say the report mischaracterised the dynamics of street violence between far-right and leftwing protesters, by suggesting white supremacist groups were “anti-Antifa” and acting simply in opposition to leftists.

"UK manufacturers buoyed by Brexit stockpiling as eurozone slumps Panic stockpiling by manufacturers before a possible no-deal Brexit sent activity in the sector surging to a 13-month high in March, according to a survey. Firms hoarded raw materials and finished goods at the fastest monthly rate of any G7 country since 1992 amid concerns that imports and exports would be held up at the UK border. The IHS Markit purchasing managers’ index (PMI) jumped to 55.1, the highest since February last year, with output, employment and new orders rising at increased rates as manufacturers and their clients raced to cram “buffer stocks” into their warehouses. The rise in UK output contrasted with a miserable month across the eurozone, which remained mired in recession after conditions deteriorated at the fastest rate in six years. Germany dragged down the eurozone PMI after falling to 44.1, an 80-month low. Italy also fell, along with France, which hovered around the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion. The only optimistic note for European manufacturers was a surprise increase in China’s output, which pushed the PMI for the world’s second largest economy to 50.8. Shares in London-listed mining companies nudged higher on the news and metal trading firm Glencore also benefited, while in Frankfurt the DAX rose 1.16% as traders became more optimistic about the sales of German cars and industrial equipment to China. The UK car manufacturing industry has also been hit by flagging sales to China. Earlier this month, car firms said their anxiety over Brexit was “at fever pitch” after monthly production figures showed a 15% year-on-year drop in output in February – the ninth consecutive month in which British car manufacturing output has fallen. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said the jump in UK manufacturing activity was directly linked to firms stepping up their preparations for potential Brexit-related disruptions. But he warned: “The stock-building boost introduces a major headwind for demand, output and jobs growth moving forward. Manufacturers are already reporting concerns that future trends could be constrained as inventory positions across the economy are unwound. “The survey is also picking up signs that EU companies are switching away from sourcing inputs from UK firms as Brexit approaches. It looks as if the impact of Brexit preparations, and any missed opportunities and investments during this sustained period of uncertainty, will reverberate through the manufacturing sector for some time to come.” The consultancy Capital Economics said its analysts were more circumspect about the impact of stockpiling. It said: “We would warn against concluding that stock building is significantly supporting overall economic growth given there is little evidence of that in other figures such as imports. And even if it was, it would only be a temporary boost to activity. “Nonetheless, considering the industrial contraction in the eurozone, UK manufacturing appears to be coping well.”",Business
"Elephant in the Room: staring down the stigma of black men's mental health A couple of years ago, the actor and choreographer Lanre Malaolu was creating a duet about mental health. “I was working with an amazing contortionist dancer,” he remembers. “But for various reasons she had to drop out … I didn’t have time to get anyone else.” He swears under his breath and smiles, before explaining how he sat in his living room and tried to come up with a quick solo performance. “I was like, ‘What’s one of the challenges that I’ve experienced with anxiety, depression? Getting out of bed.’” The scene Malaolu made “was almost verging on clownish. I was using physical theatre and hip-hop movement to show this guy just wanting to get up.” The performance went down a storm. “People were really affected by it, and were like, ‘You need to tour this around.’ I was like, ‘It’s only 15 minutes!’ But that got me thinking.” Malaolu has expanded that single scene into a full-length show, Elephant in the Room, which now has a three-week run at Camden People’s theatre in London. “Basically, it’s about a young man’s challenges with his mental health,” he says. “But also how he interacts with different characters that he’s grown up with, and how they influence his perception [of his mental wellbeing].” The piece mixes dance, theatre and spoken word, with Malaolu playing the mostly silent protagonist Michael and the other characters. Conversations about mental health have become more visible, with the likes of Zayn Malik and Prince Harry openly discussing their struggles. There has been a rise, too, in theatrical work on the subject such as Milly Thomas’s Dust, a look at one young woman’s suicide, and I’m a Phoenix, Bitch, in which performance artist Bryony Kimmings looked at her trauma-related breakdown. Masculinity and the mental health of young men are considered in Barber Shop Chronicles, which is coming to the Roundhouse, London, after two National Theatre runs and an international tour, and Fledgling Theatre’s Neck or Nothing, which is at the Pleasance theatre, London, this month, in partnership with men’s suicide prevention charity Calm. Malaolu has explored similar issues in his work before. Growing up on an estate in pre-gentrification Hackney Wick, he trained as an actor at Drama Centre London before taking a role in Anthony Nielson’s Marat/Sade, set in an asylum, for the RSC in 2011. Recently Malaolu worked as movement director for Birmingham Rep’s revival of Joe Penhall’s Blue/Orange, a dissection of institutional racism and mental health. He has also been developing his BFI-supported short film The Circle, about a pair of teenage twin brothers and the stigmas they face in the inner city. Malaolu’s interest in the topic comes from a straightforward place: “I guess I looked at myself.” He adds: “I’m not saying I’m the spokesperson for working-class black mental health. I don’t want to say that. But [Elephant in the Room] is from the perspective of a working-class black man, where things like race and class come into play.” In what way? “When you think of mental health, or when you think of having to change the way you act in public …” Malaolu trails off, before listing things such as people crossing the road to avoid young black men, and the effects of violent crime on working-class boys. He sighs. “How does that affect you if that stuff happens every day? [The show] is just dissecting that, looking and challenging that, but also putting a mirror up and saying, “Well, look. This is the shit it’s contributing to, you know?” He pauses. “Any time I hear that suicide is the biggest killer of males under 45 in the UK, I always go, ‘What the fuck?’” Malaolu’s voice betrays only a hint of apprehension when he acknowledges that a three-week run of a solo show about depression promises to be demanding. Still, he’s clearly excited to present the finished project, and it’s easy to be swept up in his enthusiasm. There’s only one thing he won’t answer: why is the play called Elephant in the Room? Malaolu grins. “Great question. Come see it.” Why should people come see it? He thinks for a minute. “I was getting a sports massage the other day, trying to prep my body,” he says, and explains that he and the masseur started talking about the show. “I said it’s about my experience with mental health within the black male community, and he was like, ‘Oh. That’s really good. I’ve had my own battle with depression.’ We spoke, and he started talking about how he had suicide attempts and stuff. We had a conversation, and by the end of it he was like, ‘Man, that’s like the first time that I could just talk with another guy about it and not feel weird.’ And I just paused. In my head, I went, ‘Yeah. This is it. Just having a conversation.’ That’s one of the things I’ll be happy with. Everyone just talking, you know?” • Elephant in the Room is at Camden People’s theatre, London, 2-20 April.",Stage
"Sport’s transgender debate needs compromise not conflict The participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports continues to be one of the most contentious issues in all of sports. One side claim that it is unfair to allow anyone who has been through male puberty to compete in the women’s division, while the other argues that anyone who identifies as female should be allowed to compete in women’s sport. I believe in a middle ground, one that respects the rights of all female athletes to enjoy meaningful competition, while also allowing those transgender women who have undergone medical transition a pathway to eligibility. My personal journey and my research have influenced my opinions. While in my 20s, I ran a marathon in 2:23, and later transitioned to female. Within nine months of starting hormone therapy in 2004, I was running 12% slower; serious male runners are 10-12% faster than equally serious female ones. In 2015, I published a study of eight trans women distance runners who competed at a similar level as men before transition and as women after transition. To be clear, this is a small study of only one sport. Before initiation of hormone therapy, trans women have all of the advantages of male athletes, so I do not believe that gender identity alone should be the gateway to allowing transgender athletes into elite level competition. However, hormone therapy – consisting of an anti-androgen agent plus oestrogen – causes trans women to lose many components of athleticism. There are not yet any published data on strength sports analogous to my study and it is certainly true that even after hormone therapy, trans women will be, on average, taller, bigger and stronger than other women. Yet the larger frames of trans women when combined with reduced muscle mass and reduced aerobic capacity lead to disadvantages. The advantages and disadvantages held by trans women play out differently in different sports. Let’s look at the fortunes of one of the biggest and strongest trans women ever to compete against other female athletes. The Australian Hannah Mouncey stands 1.88m (6ft 2in) tall, weighs 100kg (15st 10lb), played for the Australian men’s handball team, and is still in her 20s. If there ever was a trans woman who would dominate her sport, then Mouncey is she. Mouncey played for the Australian women’s handball team in the December 2018 Asian championships. Look online and several pictures of Mouncey show her towering over opponents. But optics don’t always tell the full story. Clearly, Mouncey’s size and strength are advantages, but she was only the third-leading scorer for a team placed fifth in a 10-team tournament. Neither Mouncey nor her team dominated. Beyond individuals, it is useful to look at population studies. The largest and longest of these would be collegiate sports in America. Each year more than 200,000 women compete in NCAA sports and the system has allowed trans women to compete after hormone therapy since 2011. Trans people make up between 0.5% and 1.0% of the population, and so there should be more than 1,000 trans women competing in the NCAA every year. Yet, eight years after the hormone‑based rules were implemented, there are only a handful of trans women in American collegiate sports and they have won nothing of importance. Paula Radcliffe and others have suggested that the current limit of 10 nanomoles per litre of testosterone (T) for trans women is too high – cisgender (or typical) women are usually under 2nmol/L – and I agree. In 2017, I was on a committee that recommended to the International Olympic Committee that it should reduce the limit to 5nmol/L, and I believe this change will be implemented for next year’s Tokyo Games. It is important to note that 5nmol/L is an upper limit. Most trans women carry less than 1nmol/L of T after hormone therapy, and will likely have lower T levels than the women they compete against. Additionally, cisgender women with polycystic ovary syndrome can approach 5nmol/L and are still allowed to compete. Lastly, I have been one of many to call for more transgender athletic research, especially into the area of muscle memory. Scientists at both Loughborough and Brighton Universities (along with a handful of other institutions worldwide) are initiating studies, and the IOC is offering research grants of up to $100,000. Lord Coe, the chancellor of Loughborough University as well as president of track and field’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, has said that transgender athletic research is among the most important research areas of the next 20 years. I think that, data permitting, we should eventually have sport-specific rules for transgender athletes, but that for now, imposing a limit of 5nmol/L of testosterone on trans women is the best condition we have to allow equitable competition for all athletes.",Sport
"Ukraine elections: TV comic favourite to win in presidential runoff Ukraine’s runoff election is likely to pit a comedian who plays the president on TV against the country’s actual president – and the comedian is the favourite to win. Analysts expect a tough campaign that will see extra attention given to corruption scandals and ties to prominent oligarchs. And the country’s current president has called the possibility of his losing the “Russian scenario,” painting his opponent as the candidate preferred by Moscow. With more than 90% of Sunday’s first-round results counted, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has taken a commanding lead, with 30.26% of the vote, ahead of Petro Poroshenko, the incumbent, who is on 15.99%. Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, has 13.35% and appears unlikely to catch Poroshenko to secure a place in the runoff. Zelenskiy’s dark horse candidacy has been the big surprise of this year’s elections. The 41-year-old has no political experience and has largely relied on a wave of anger with Poroshenko and government corruption to carry him to victory. On his television show, Servant of the People, he plays a high-school teacher who becomes president after his rant against corruption goes viral online. Polling shows that Ukrainians are fed up after years of stalling reforms, rising costs, and a war against Russia-backed separatists in the country’s south-east. They also want new faces – both Poroshenko and Tymoshenko have been in politics for years. “This is only the first step toward a great victory,” Zelenskiy said after seeing the exit poll findings on Monday evening, which showed him with more than 30% of the vote. A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology shows that Zelenskiy would be supported in the second round by 43% of Tymoshenko voters and 52% of fourth-place Yuriy Boiko’s voters, indicating he is the clear favourite to win. Poroshenko would only be supported by 11% and 2% of those respective candidates’ voters, the poll said. Zelenskiy has been vague about his policies if elected president. He has said broadly that he would support Ukraine’s integration with the west and would seek peace in the south-east through talks with Russia, a sentiment that is broadly popular but may not be realistic. But he has avoided debates and held few interviews with journalists. In brief remarks to the press on Sunday evening, he said he was ready to debate with Poroshenko during the next round and would soon announce a core team of five advisers. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former finance minister who supports Zelenskiy, said he would also release a plan for his first 100 days in office. As the results came in, both Poroshenko and Zelenskiy launched opening salvos in what will likely be a bitterly fought second round. “Fate has pitted me against Kolomoisky’s puppet,” declared Poroshenko in a reference to Ihor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian oligarch who has business dealings with Zelenskiy. “I am going to destroy him,” Mikhail Fyodorov, Zelenskiy’s head of digital strategy, said of Poroshenko. The attacks would be “much harsher” in the second round, he said. Poroshenko showed contrition after the election results were delivered, trying to appease voters who believe his administration has grown out of touch. “I critically and soberly understand the signal that society gave today to the acting authorities,” he said. “It’s a tough lesson for me and my team. It’s a reason for serious work to correct mistakes made over the past years.” The highly contested vote had been held amid concerns about tampering. Police said they had received more than 2,100 complaints of violations on polling day alone in addition to hundreds of earlier voting fraud claims, including bribery attempts and removing ballots from polling stations. But there were encouraging notes in Sunday’s elections, including a broad rejection of far-right candidates and the rise of an outsider candidate in Zelenskiy, whose Jewish heritage has remained an afterthought during the campaign. In the second round, greater attention will likely be placed on a corruption scandal involving military embezzlement linked to Poroshenko. Poroshenko has indicated he will attack Zelenskiy for the comedian’s business dealings with Kolomoisky. Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian business oligarch, has publicly feuded with Poroshenko and been accused of financing his main rivals in the elections. The government nationalised PrivatBank, in which he owned a stake, in 2016. But his 1+1 television station has served as the main platform for Zelenskiy to reach voters. Comedy shows with Zelenskiy and Servant of the People have been shown daily on the channel. International observers on Monday noted the fractured media landscape and lack of debates in their criticism of Sunday’s election, but largely indicated they would view the vote as free and fair. “I saw a free vote by free people,” said Michal Szczerba, head of the NATO PA delegation to Ukraine.",World news
"How casting across racial lines exposes Hollywood’s power imbalance When is it OK to cast across racial lines? This is one of the movie questions of our time, and it’s complicated. Let’s take two recent, apparently contradictory examples. Case one: Mary Queen of Scots, which included Gemma Chan – a British actor of Chinese descent – as Bess of Hardwick, a real-life, very-much-white ally of Elizabeth I. For some, Chan’s casting was “historically inaccurate”. Case two: the forthcoming Hellboy reboot, which made headlines last year when Ed Skrein (white, British) was cast as Ben Daimio, a Japanese-American character. In response to the angry reaction, Skrein withdrew from the role, and was replaced by Korean actor Daniel Dae Kim. So in the first instance, the argument is “race doesn’t matter” and in the second, the argument is “it really, really does matter”. Confusing, huh? The first thing to remember is how, until recently, most Hollywood and British movies were created, controlled and performed by white people – even the non-white characters. “If John Wayne can play Ghenghis Khan, I can play Bess of Hardwick,” stated Chan in a recent interview, questioning why actors of colour are only allowed to play their own race. And yet they see plum Asian roles taken by white actors, such as Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell. It was a similar story with Hellboy’s Ben Daimio. Sure, he’s a comic-book character, but one whose Japanese heritage is an essential part of his identity. Why cast a white guy? Yes, Bess of Hardwick had no Chinese ancestry, but if we’re talking “historical accuracy”, let’s acknowledge how much disbelief we already suspend when it comes to historical movies. Most Elizabethans had manky teeth, terrible skincare and bad lighting. They did not speak in modern English. Mary probably had a French accent, not a Scottish one. And the whole movie is premised on an encounter between the two queens that never actually took place. It is fiction, not documentary. What’s more, there have been people of colour in Britain since at least Roman times, so erasing them (as countless previous movies have done) is no less inaccurate. The other example Chan cited was Hamilton – a musical whose creators’ and performers’ non-whiteness is arguably the principal reason for its success. As Lin-Manuel Miranda has often said, Hamilton is a story of “America then, told by America now”. It’s the same with movies, and not just historical ones: they always reflect the “now”. And what both Mary Queen of Scots and Hellboy are saying in this particular moment is that they get it about representation. Chan’s casting helps to correct a systemic imbalance; Hellboy’s whitewashing threatened to perpetuate that same imbalance. There’s no real contradiction.",Film
"'I’m skint – I know why people buy cheap meat’: the truth about being a farmer Spring in the countryside near Hadrian’s Wall is a scenic season for visitors, all grassy meadows and lambs gambolling in the sunshine. But it’s hard labour for Sally Urwin. The small, cheerful Northumbrian farmer is lambing from 6am to 9pm every day (her husband, Steve, takes the night shift). Her first book, a diary of a year on their 80-hectare (200-acre) farm, has been published, meaning Urwin must also take a bottle-fed lamb to various “scary” literary festivals. Then, looming over every family farm like a particularly black rain cloud, is Brexit. Farmers have a reputation for looking on the gloomy side of life, but Urwin, 44, is a naturally upbeat person. A Farmer’s Diary combines humour and the stark reality of modern farming, often in the same anecdote, such as the moment the “knacker van”, filled with a pungent pile of dead ewes, drives into their yard just as guests assemble for a wedding party. In fact, says Urwin, this spring’s lambing – their 150 ewes are expecting 240 lambs – won’t be as bad as last year’s, which happened during the visit from the “beast from the east”. “That was the hardest one I’ve ever done. Steve had lost his other job, I was still trying to do extra work and the weather was just atrocious. I was standing outside, the snow was coming past and it was absolutely freezing. You can’t have lambs out when it’s that cold, so we were running out of spaces in the barn. Somebody sent me a care package because I had moaned so much on Twitter, and that was lovely. Somebody else gave us a lasagne, and Steve burst into tears.” Urwin, who has two children, Lucy, 12, and Ben, eight, has a lucid perspective on farming, perhaps because she is an “outsider”. Urwin grew up near Newcastle, and was enduring what she calls the world’s most depressing job – marketing manager for a bankruptcy practitioner – when she met Steve, a fourth-generation farmer, on a dating website. She soon joined him at work on the mixed farm – sheep and crops, including wheat and oilseed rape – that Steve had inherited from his father. Urwin admits she had a “completely” romanticised view of farming. “And other people do. They see you on the farm, and think it’s like a Boden advert. It’s not, and it’s hard work. Things such as having a picnic in the hayfield – it’s never as good as you think it’s going to be. A lot of people say: ‘Can I visit the farm?’ I say: ‘Yes, come and let the kids run,’ but we don’t sit down on tablecloths and have ginger beer.” When she became a farmer, Urwin had another awakening. “I didn’t realise how skint everybody was. Everybody is really skint.” The land rolls away from the small farm worker’s end-of-terrace house that is the Urwins’ home (the big, old stone farmhouse was sold off generations ago) and they are surrounded by birds, peace and space. Urwin waves towards the fields and the lane of ancient hollies. “We’re not living in some bucolic, amazing place. We’re still trying to keep up with everybody else, but, on the other hand, look at it – absolutely gorgeous. I love it.” Thirty years ago, says Urwin, small farmers could still make a reasonable living, and employed local workers. These days, the paid help is long gone, and the best Urwin can get during lambing is voluntary assistance from her nonfarming 74-year-old father, and her brother, who is a doctor, “so he’s good at injections”. To survive, the Urwins obeyed the government’s edict to “diversify”. They opened a microbrewery, tea-room and wedding venue in an old shed. But this work removed them from the farming that they both loved. So they sold the brewery and weddings business, although they still receive crucial rental income from it. Sally and Steve then supported their farm with second jobs: Sally does 16 hours a week of marketing work from home, but Steve recently quit his part-time job in an agricultural retailer because overwork made him constantly sick. “I can’t physically drive a tractor – my feet can’t reach the pedals,” laughs Urwin, “and Steve was making himself ill by rushing home, going straight out, working until midnight on the land. My doctor brother says his workload is equivalent. So we’re not complaining. Well, we are a little bit.” Given the growing number of visitors to the brewery, the Urwins have found themselves farming in a more public way – meeting an urban population living more remotely than ever from the land. Urwin says 99% of visitors are “fabulous”, but she’ll still find a wedding drunk trying to ride their only tractor. Or walkers crossing lamb-filled fields, with their dogs off the lead. “When you say to them: ‘Please don’t do that,’ they say: ‘I’m in control of my dog.’ Yes, but the sheep don’t know that. I come from a townie perspective, so I can understand. I show people around the farm, and a lot of people don’t know the difference between hay and straw. I didn’t when I first met Steve.” A party of visitors once found Urwin asleep – exhausted – on the straw next to the lambing shed door, and asked for the farmer. They were amazed when she said she was. “I refuse to say: ‘Oh, I’m the farmer’s wife.’ It makes me sound like I’m in a nursery rhyme or I stand in the kitchen making yorkshire puddings and pots of tea,” she writes. The life of a modern livestock farmer increasingly involves defending their business on social media from critical vegans. Urwin explains that many animal welfare arguments don’t apply to small, traditional operations, which are a world away from “factory” farming. “We get a lot of vegans on Twitter saying we’re forcing our sheep to get pregnant, but it’s not like that,” says Urwin. Their tups (the males) – “horrible looking things”, laughs Urwin – are put with the ewes once a year, and the tups are often given short shrift. “The ewes will only ‘stand’ for a tup when they want to,” she says. Ultimately, however, even if she is raising animals to live good lives outdoors, these lives are cut short to be eaten. Urwin has made a point of visiting the abattoir where her lambs go. “I don’t want them to know that they’re being slaughtered, and they don’t. At least, I can’t see that they do.” The worst moment, according to Urwin, is parting with ewes that have given them six years of loyal service (they are sold, cheaply, for mutton). “You put them on the trailer, and they try to run towards you, rather than away from you. But we wouldn’t have the sheep if we didn’t also sell them for meat. I’ve got to keep thinking of that.” Urwin would like more local abattoirs, so stressful travel could be reduced for livestock. Ideally people would eat less, higher-quality, meat that they could sell at the farm gate. “But I’m skint, so I can understand why people buy cheap food,” she says. “We’re worried that, with Brexit, we’ll get a flood of imports with low-quality antibiotic-filled meat. But I tend to keep off subjects like that. I get shouted at a lot by people on Twitter, mostly by angry vegans, although some of them are very nice.” Social media causes Urwin anxiety, but there is an upside – she and other farmers are increasingly honest about their mental health problems. Loneliness in farming has been exacerbated by the loss of communal farm labour, she points out, but social media helps farmers support each other. Urwin has just been gathering tips online about how to offer farm visits to the public; she is already part of the FaceTime a Farmer programme, which connects schools with farmers. Urwin is also broaching another taboo, about farming finances. Despite the Urwins’ assets, their profits are variable, and tiny. Last year, she and Steve sought help from an agricultural charity that helps struggling farmers pay their household bills. “We don’t tell people that because a lot of the older farming generation don’t wash their dirty linen in public,” she says. “I thought: feck it, I’m just going to let people know how bad it is. I’m a bit worried about that because I haven’t told many people how desperate it got last year. It’s better now.” Then along came Brexit. There’s one certainty amid all the uncertainty over leaving the EU: the money given to British farmers via the common agricultural policy will mostly be put to other uses by future British governments. All farmers receive a “basic payment” subsidy based on their hectares of cultivation. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has announced it will phase out these payments by 2027. According to another farmer who works closely with Defra, the government privately predicts that one-third of farms will go out of business. Can the Urwins survive? Sally admits she is worried, and calls Steve over to join our conversation. “The basic payment is our profit,” says Steve. “You take that away, we’re break-even. If we had a bad farming year, we’d be in big losses. The traditional farm will no longer, in my opinion, be viable, without off-farm income. It’s going to be the big estates who …” “… will suck up all the small ones,” says Sally. The familiar answer is to diversify, but the Urwins have already done that. They have considered relocating to Scotland, where land prices are cheaper. But they’re still hoping they can save their farm by expanding their camping, and diversifying into free-range chickens. So what is the appeal of a physically and mentally taxing sub-minimum-wage job with no secure future and additional hassle from the public? “Because it’s a dream to live here,” says Sally. “People have said to me: ‘Why don’t you sell up and live off the proceeds?’ I don’t think we could because we’d miss it so much. There are many more positives than negatives. I am really grateful to be here. It sounds like Disney, but I love seeing the wildlife and I love having that connection with the animals. But it would be nice to earn a decent wage.” A Farmer’s Diary – A Year at High House Farm by Sally Urwin is published by Profile on 4 April",Environment
"Nipsey Hussle: Grammy-nominated rapper shot dead in LA The Grammy-nominated rapper and community activist Nipsey Hussle has been shot dead outside his Los Angeles clothing store, aged 33. Three men were shot on Sunday outside Marathon Clothing, and one of them was later declared dead in hospital, said police, without revealing the identity of the victim. The LA Times and NBC quoted police sources as saying the victim was Hussle. The city’s mayor, Eric Garcetti tweeted: “Our hearts are with the loved ones of Nipsey Hussle and everyone touched by this awful tragedy. LA is hurt deeply each time a young life is lost to senseless gun violence. My Crisis Response Team is assisting the families coping with shock and grief.” Police said the other two men were in a stable condition. The gunman fled, and no arrests have been made. “At this point, we’re not even sure as to whether he walked up, rode a bicycle or drove up in a car,” said LA police lieutenant Chris Ramirez. Just hours before his death, Hussle tweeted: “Having strong enemies is a blessing.” Major US stars have paid tribute. Rihanna tweeted: “This doesn’t make any sense! My spirit is shaken by this! Dear God may His spirit Rest In Peace and May You grant divine comfort to all his loved ones!” Drake wrote: “You were having the best run … you were a real one to your people and to the rest of us.” During a concert in Buenos Aires, Kendrick Lamar, who also hails from south LA and had collaborated with Hussle, described him as “our brother, our warrior, our soldier”, and led a moment of silence among the crowd. Hussle had recently recorded with DJ Khaled, and had posted footage from a music video they were making together. Khaled wrote on Instagram that Hussle was “a great man … an inspiration to the whole world”. J Cole, Meek Mill, Vince Staples, and Chance the Rapper were among the other rappers paying tribute. Hussle was a supporter of the LA Lakers basketball team, who posted a tribute online reading: “Artist. Activist. Angeleno. LA mourns the loss of one of our own, Nipsey Hussle.” The star Lakers player LeBron James wrote on Instagram: “Just spoke with you the other day on text bro! Telling you how proud I was of you and how I was gone get you to more Laker games next season. Been a stand up dude from day 1. May you rest in paradise … this one hurts big time!” Another NBA star, Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry, wrote: “Just got to know you! Rest in paradise.” Hussle was celebrated for his gritty, socially conscious lyricism, and was nominated for best rap album at this year’s Grammy awards. Born Ermias Davidson Asghedom in south Los Angeles in 1985 to an Eritrean father and American mother, he was a member of the Crips gang Rollin 60s as a young man. “It was like living in a war zone, where people die on these blocks and everybody is a little bit immune to it,” he told the LA Times in 2018 of his time with the gang. “I guess they call it post-traumatic stress, when you have people that have been at war for such a long time. I think LA suffers from that because it’s not normal yet we embrace it like it is after a while.” His rap career began in the mid-2000s, making early collaborations with Drake and Snoop Dogg and getting signed to Epic Records. The major label deal was an unhappy one and led to an album being indefinitely shelved, and he didn’t release his debut album, Victory Lap, until 2018. It reached No 4 in the US charts, and features collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, Diddy and YG. Another YG collaboration, FDT, became perhaps his most famous track: a withering attack on the US president with the chorus, “Fuck Donald Trump.” He also released a series of acclaimed mixtapes, including The Marathon (2010) and Crenshaw (2013). The 2014 mixtape Mailbox Money was available free online, but physical copies cost $1,000 each. Hussle invested in community projects in Los Angeles, including a co-working space called Vector90 that hosts entrepreneurs in Crenshaw. It includes a programme called Too Big to Fail, designed to help local people train in science, technology, engineering and maths. Hussle described it as a “bridge between Silicon Valley and the inner city” and had intended to create a national network of centres. Hussle was also working on Destination Crenshaw, a 1.3-mile open air museum in the Crenshaw district, featuring free open-air art installations. American footballer and activist Colin Kaepernick paid tribute to Hussle’s community work, writing: “This is so painful! Nipsey Hussle was doing great work for the people. Keep his legacy alive by carrying on his work!” • Associated Press contributed to this report.",Music
"Jeremy Bowen reveals he is being treated for bowel cancer Jeremy Bowen, the veteran BBC foreign correspondent, has revealed that he is being treated for bowel cancer. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, a show he used to present, Bowen said he was diagnosed with the disease last October. “I had some funny pains in my legs and my back when I was in Iraq last May, and when I came back I had to go to hospital for a couple of days but they didn’t mention cancer, they said it was to do with scar tissue that I had from a previous surgery,” he told the hosts Dan Walker and Louise Minchin. “But I thought I should get a test, so I went to my GP, and I’d had none of the classic bowel cancer symptoms, nothing at all, but I thought I should get a test. “So I got a test and it was positive. I had a colonoscopy where they put a camera on a stick up your bottom, [which] is not nearly as bad as it sounds, and they give you lots of drugs and from that they found out that I had a tumour, and I had surgery, got [it] taken away and now I’m having chemotherapy.” He said his diagnosis “could have been a bit earlier, but had it been much later it would have been much worse”, and he urged viewers not to be embarrassed to go to their doctors if they feel pain. “The key thing is to get tested … Bowels and poo are not the normal things people want to talk about, but don’t die of embarrassment, for God’s sake.” Bowen said he had decided to go public for Bowel Cancer Awareness Month. “I’ve kept quiet about it except to my nearest and dearest and friends, but I thought why not? “And if me coming on your programme means a few extra people decide to get tested and as a result get their cancers caught, then it’s time well spent. Actually if there is something wrong with you, it’s far better to know. There’s great treatment there.” He added: “It’s more reassuring to know that something’s being dealt with than thinking: ‘I’ll wait till next week’. Don’t wait till next week!” Bowen is the BBC’s Middle East editor and has worked for the broadcaster since 1984. He has reported from more than 70 countries and covered conflicts in the Middle East and the former republics of Yugoslavia.",Society
"Brexit customs union bad for foreign policy and trade, says Truss The idea of Brexit based on a customs union is “incredibly problematic”, Liz Truss has said, as Theresa May faces increasingly open cabinet splits before a new round of indicative votes which could point the way towards a softer departure. With MPs expected to vote on Monday evening on some of the eight tabled proposals, the chief secretary to the Treasury said she vehemently opposed the idea of the government backing a customs union if MPs voted for the option. The justice secretary, David Gauke, said on Sunday he did not think it would be “sustainable to ignore parliament’s position” if MPs ruled out a no-deal Brexit and opted for a customs union. However Truss said a customs union was not good for UK trade or foreign policy and that if May definitively backed that option or a no-deal departure she could lose a large contingent of ministers from either the leave or remain sides of her cabinet. “I think it’s incredibly problematic, the idea of a customs union,” Truss told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It would mean that control of our trade policy sat with the European Union whilst we were no longer a member, where we would have no influence. That would have consequences for our foreign policy, we wouldn’t be able to strike independent trade deals.” Asked if this meant she would quit the cabinet if a customs union became the policy, Truss said: “I don’t go round threatening to resign, I don’t think that is appropriate or right. I will very strongly argue against that. I will be arguing that we should be following an alternative path.” Amid the open bickering, comments emerged overnight in which the Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, said May faced “the worst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history”. In highly unusual comments for someone holding his post, Smith told a BBC documentary about Brexit that after losing her majority in the 2017 election, May should have possibly laid the way for an inevitable softer Brexit. “The thing that people forget is that the Conservative party went to get a majority in order to deliver Brexit, [and] failed to get a majority,” he said. “The government as a whole probably should just have been clearer on the consequences of that. The parliamentary arithmetic would mean that this would be inevitably a softer type of Brexit.” Attention on Monday will focus on the second series of non-binding votes, the next stage of a process led by the veteran Conservative MP Oliver Letwin in which the Commons has taken control of parliamentary business. In the first series of eight votes last week, none of the options commanded a majority, although a customs union proposal fell just six votes short. A similar palette of options has been tabled for Monday, with the Speaker, John Bercow, due to select a number of them for votes. The focus will mainly be on whether a customs union or “common market 2.0” can gain more support, as well as a proposal to put any final deal to a confirmatory referendum. Truss said last week’s votes had left her sceptical about whether MPs could find a way forward. “It’s not like there’s this brilliant plan out there that everyone wants to vote for,” she said. “If you look at the parliamentary arithmetic now, it’s not clear that something like a customs union actually commands support.” She said the solution “lies in modifications to the prime minister’s deal”, which was voted down for a third time last week, albeit in a modified form, with the withdrawal agreement separated from details of the planned future relationship with the EU. “I’m going to sound like a total optimist here, but it was less than we lost by last time, and we are seeing people coming on board. I think we need to carry on looking at how we get the support for that deal,” Truss said. There is signifiant speculation May could bring her plan back for a fourth vote later in the week. However, the Democratic Unionist party, whose 10 MPs would be vital for it to pass, have consistently maintained they cannot back it because of the backstop provision for the Northern Irish border. On Monday the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, told the BBC his party would “vote it down 1,000 times” because the implications for Northern Ireland were far too serious. “First of all, it would take us away from the country that we fought to stay part of,” he said. “And secondly, it would break us away from the economy on which we are dependent.” Truss said that if May’s deal could not get through she would support no deal rather than risk no Brexit, saying the nation was well-prepared for such an option. “I don’t have any fear of no deal,.”",Politics
"How North Korea got away with the assassination of Kim Jong-nam The morning of 13 February 2017 was like any other at Kuala Lumpur’s hectic international airport terminal so it would have been easy to miss a lone North Korean man, clad in a blue polo shirt and jeans, heading to check into his flight to Macau. As he ambled past a column, a backpack slung over one shoulder, a woman approached him and wiped an oily substance on his face before disappearing, her unusual actions caught on CCTV. Moments later, another woman came from behind and covered his eyes with her hands. She then slid them down over his mouth, quickly apologised and walked away. Less than 20 minutes later the man was dead, the victim of an assassination carried out with the nerve agent VX, one of the most deadly chemical weapons in the world. The traveller was Kim Jong-nam, half brother of Kim Jong-un and one-time heir to the North Korean leadership who had since fallen out of favour with his powerful family. As the attack was carried out, in scenes that would not be out of place in a James Bond film, at least four North Korean agents were hiding nearby to witness the public killing and ready with a back-up plan if anything went wrong. In the hours after the attack, those agents passed through immigration checkpoints and boarded flights out of the country, accompanied by a North Korean diplomat. Their flight routes back to Pyongyang were carefully calculated to avoid countries that may ground their planes and arrest the men. “The reason to do it publicly is to leave a calling card, to show the world that Kim Jong-un is not afraid to use a weapon of mass destruction at a crowded international airport,” said Vipin Narang, a politics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Indeed, the people who would find themselves on trial for the murder were not agents of the North Korean state but two former escorts, Siti Aisyah, from Indonesia, and Doan Thi Huong, from Vietnam. The women, according to their testimonies, had been unknowingly groomed as killers by North Korean agents in the months previous. It was Siti and Doan who had smeared the substance on Kim Jong-nam’s face, later both telling Malaysian police they thought they were carrying out a prank for a Japanese YouTube show. In March, all charges were dropped against Siti and Doan found herself the sole person accused of murder. On Monday, she was offered a deal – accept a lower charge of causing hurt with a dangerous weapon and face 10 years in prison, instead of a mandatory sentence of death by hanging if found guilty of murder. She agreed, saying only “I’m happy” in court. Doan was sentenced to three years and four months but her legal team said that with usual sentence reductions, she would be released in May. Death and a diplomatic crisis The killing of Kim Jong-nam on foreign soil caused a major diplomatic crisis between North Korea and Malaysia, with Malaysia expelling the North Korean ambassador, refusing to release Kim Jong-nam’s body to Pyongyang and demanding three North Koreans hiding in the embassy come in for questioning by the police, to which North Korea responded by holding hostage all Malaysians in North Korea. However, in the two years since the murder, behind-the-scenes diplomacy has taken over and appears to have significantly influenced how events have unfolded in the courtroom. After a judge ruled that both Siti and Doan should testify, a full-blown diplomatic campaign began in Indonesia. President Jokowi met the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, twice in 2018 to press for Siti’s release. It proved effective; in an order signed by the attorney general that cited the “good relations” between Malaysia and Indonesia, Siti was acquitted in March. But it is not just Indonesia the Malaysian government has been accused of appeasing. The decision to let Siti go and allow Doan to plead guilty to a lesser charge has led to accusations that the Malaysian government wanted to be done with the trial because it was diplomatically inconvenient. Before the assassination, North Korea and Malaysia had four decades of good diplomatic and trade ties, which were strengthened under Mahathir the first time he was in power in the 1990s. It is believed that Mahathir, who took power again in May last year, was keen to recover the relationship. “What is now clear is that the Malaysian government considered the recovery of the relationship between Pyongyang and Kuala Lumpur to be more important than justice for the assassination of Kim Jong-nam,” said Dr Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University who previously worked in South Korea’s Intelligence agency. “Kim Jong-un’s status is on the rise now he is meeting with the US president and the Vietnamese prime minister and leaders in the region, and Malaysia also wants to be part of this conversation.” A UN report, released in March, which investigated violations of the UN arms embargo and financial sanctions against North Korea, named Malaysia as one of the key culprits, singling out several Malaysian companies and senior business figures who had benefited from clandestine deals. “Some members of the ruling party are deeply involved in financial networks that are partly North Korean so the government clearly don’t want to alienate North Korea with this trial dragging on; it will cost them money and embarrassment and perhaps even international sanctions,” said Dr Remco Breuker, an expert on North Korea at Leiden University. ‘Washing away North Korea’s sins’ From his birth in 1971, as the eldest son of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam was slated to rule North Korea. But after being sent to a Swiss boarding school, he developed a taste for luxury items and a decadent lifestyle. In 2001, in an incident seen to embarrass his family, Kim Jong-nam was arrested trying to enter Japan to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He later spoke publicly about his belief in political and economic reform for North Korea. But he was still seen as a potential rival to his younger brother, Kim Jong-un. There were at least two botched assassination attempts against him in 2010 and 2012 and Kim Jong-un was rumoured to have issued a standing order to kill his older brother. His eventual murder was seen to be a warning shot aimed at high-level North Korean defectors such as Thae Yong-ho, the former North Korean ambassador to Great Britain, who had recently spoken out publicly. It proved effective; in the aftermath Thae Yong-ho and several others cancelled all public appearances and have kept a low profile since. The apparent decision by North Korea to recruit and groom two innocent women to carry out the killing appeared to be an attempt by Kim Jong-un to avoid a repeat of the Rangoon bombing incident in Burma in 1983, when two North Korean officers who attempted to publicly assassinate the South Korean president, Chun Doo-hwan, were captured and put on trial. Instead,the real perpetrators in Pyongyang, who both the US and South Korea have definitively concluded are guilty of orchestrating the crime, have faced no retribution for the assassination. “You’d expect ramifications for North Korea, but given the welcome Kim Jong-un received when he went to Singapore and then Vietnam for the nuclear summits with Trump, no, I don’t think so,” said Breuker. “The international community are very good at washing away North Korea’s sins for them.” He added: “I don’t think North Korea cared either way whether these women were released or executed, for them this was over long ago. North Korea hasn’t been indicted, the people who were connected to the killing left the country in the immediate aftermath, so they got away scot-free. As the assassination and this trial have shown, they can act with near total impunity and will probably do so again.”",World news
"Football transfer rumours: Paul Pogba to Real Madrid in player swap? Zinedine Zidane is not a man prone to particularly interesting public utterances or revelations, but that hasn’t stopped assorted folk pouncing on some typically anodyne comments from the Real Madrid manager in a bid to find some hidden meaning. Speaking about Gareth Bale, a player with whom he does not seem to enjoy a particularly good working relationship, Zidane stressed the winger’s importance to Real Madrid as they sleepwalk through their final 10 games of a season to forget, but was non-committal about the Welshman’s future. “Nobody can take away what he has done,” said Zizou. “We know he can bring a lot to the team and we will count on him. We are going to play these 10 games and then we will see. That does not mean that, afterwards, there will be changes.” Reports from Spain reiterate persistent rumours that Manchester United are interested in Bale and could insist on getting him and Toni Kroos as part of any deal that involves Paul Pogba going the other way. “He has always said that, after Manchester, Madrid has always interested him,” said Zizou, shortly after stressing that Pogba is not his player. “So when his experience at Manchester ends, why not come here to Madrid?” Very subtle. Whatever about Pogba, Juan Mata’s time at Old Trafford looks to be drawing to a close. The likeable Spaniard’s contract is due to expire come season’s end and it seems Mata could move to Barcelona. The La Liga leaders have apparently approached his dad – who doubles as the player’s “people” – with a view to taking him to the Camp Nou on a free transfer this summer. In other news pertaining to Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain may try to turn the head of goalkeeper David de Gea, while Ole Gunnar Solskjær will move heaven, earth and a small part of south-west London to bring Crystal Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Old Trafford. Everton boss Marco Silva has dropped a sledgehammer subtle hint to his employers regarding the future of loanee André Gomes, who he would quite like to sign from Barcelona on a permanent deal. “Let’s see what we can do,” he said, shortly after lavishing praise on his compatriot. “You know my opinion, he is really important for us but, in the end, it will be business and as you know, it is not my job.” In the section of this Rumour Mill some cynics may think is an April Fool’s joke but actually isn’t, Atlético Madrid would like to sign full-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester City. For their part, the Foxes are reported to be in talks with Monaco about making Youri Tielemans’ loan move to the King Power Stadium more permanent. The reign of Jan Siewert at Huddersfield Town could come to an end before it really got going, if a report in the Times that the German has fallen out with several senior players turns out to be true. Huddersfield’s relegation to the Championship was confirmed by their defeat at the hands of Crystal Palace on Saturday. And finally – tee-hee … oho-ho-ho … wink-wink … nudge-nudge – Chelsea will offer to replay the final 10 minutes of Sunday’s victory over Cardiff City, following the glaring error from match officials that Neil Warnock feels cost his side the game. César Azpilicueta was a yard offside when he headed a Chelsea equaliser six minutes from time, before Ruben Loftus-Cheek popped up in added time to grab a late winner. Chelsea will submit their application that the end of the game be replayed – with the score still 1-0 to Cardiff – to the Premier League, who will consider their proposal and make a ruling on the matter before stumps at FA HQ later on Monday.",Football

"A customs union would not solve the Brexit conundrum Parliament has a little over one week to prove that it can do what Theresa May should have allowed it to do after her failure in the 2017 election, and come up with a plan that saves us from the Brexit cliff edge. The question is whether it can, without the constraints of Mrs May’s self-imposed red lines, agree a deal based on the creation of a permanent customs union, and perhaps also continuing membership of the single market. Only a minority of the Conservative party, which now looks increasingly like the leave campaign, would buy into this, as most now want to leave the EU with as “clean” a break as possible, however painful. But we may find in the coming days that there is a cross-party majority of MPs – including possibly the DUP – who are willing to back a softer form of Brexit. Negotiations to see whether a compromise is possible are the only alternative to what the former Brexit minister, Lord Bridges, has described as the British public being asked to walk a gangplank into thin air. Take a customs union on its own first. As a former EU trade commissioner and UK business secretary, I can see both the advantages and drawbacks of this proposal. A customs union would create far less friction to trade in goods. It would be easier to keep vital manufacturing supply chains intact and it would obviate the need for the customs part of the Irish backstop, as long as agriculture was included. But it would also mean that Britain could not operate an independent trade policy in respect of goods, because we would be obliged by the EU to operate its external tariff rather than vary our own in bilateral trade agreements with non-EU countries. It is not true to say that we would simply have to adopt the EU-Turkey model, in which the rules require them to open their own market under EU trade deals without benefiting from reciprocal rights for their exports. The EU, in my opinion, could do better for the UK than that. The biggest shortcoming of a customs union, however – and it is a major shortcoming – is that it does not in itself address the issue of regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU that single market membership gives us. This is the principal guarantee of the barrier-free trade we enjoy currently with the EU and why every alternative to membership will leave us worse off. So a customs union is not a panacea. For this reason, many MPs are looking to a deeper agreement with the EU, one they call common market 2.0, which in addition to a customs union would mean continuing membership of the single market. The attraction is obvious: it would keep the UK close to its most important trading partner while fulfilling the mandate to leave the EU. It comes with a set of institutions based on the existing European Economic Area through which the UK could potentially influence (but not determine) EU policy and incur reduced UK payments for market access. The disadvantages are equally clear. Britain would have to operate EU rules, without a vote or a veto, for both goods and services – becoming a rule taker – making it largely pointless to leave. Free movement of people would also continue. Yes, there is provision for an emergency brake on migration but this would not give Britain “control” of its borders. How important this issue is for UK voters is something upon which MPs will have different views. Undoubtedly, maximising the trade benefits for Britain requires both continued customs union and single market membership and it would be hailed with relief by most of UK business except some in financial services who do not want to be regulated from Brussels. This route would be relatively easy to negotiate in contrast to May’s favoured alternative – her hybrid half-in, half-out Chequers plan, which is regarded as a unicorn by anyone with knowledge of how the EU works. EU member states would initially welcome it as a means of maintaining the close relationship they seek with Brexit Britain. Do not underestimate, though, the prospects over time for tension and argument as the UK pushes up against the boundaries of what is permitted, for example on questions such as subsidies for firms to advance industrial policy objectives and possibly corporate tax harmonisation. Which leaves one, big question: would the British people buy it? My hunch is they would not. Every politician will make their own judgement about the electorate’s likely choice between a pointless Brexit in which we leave the EU but continue to follow its rules – a sort of Hotel California Brexit – and an economically painful one. In 2016, there is good reason to suspect that most people thought it would be neither. It is this uncertainty about what was really mandated in the last referendum that makes it necessary, and democratically legitimate, for the choice of a particular form of Brexit to be validated through the ballot box. A general election would almost certainly fail to give a clearcut answer to any question other than who should form a government, and perhaps not even that. Where I disagree with those wedded to the original 2016 result is their belief that voters would resent being asked to confirm that the deal on offer is the one they want. Democracy did not end in 2016. It shows an arrogance and a contempt for democracy to suggest otherwise. • Peter Mandelson is a Labour party politician and a former EU trade commissioner",Opinion
"FC Cincinnati pull in crowds as MLS continues its knack for expansion Before Atlanta United, expansion teams in Major League Soccer were given something of a free pass. Between 1997, when the Chicago Fire became the division’s first expansion franchise, and 2016, when The Five Stripes entered the fray, only one expansion side (Seattle Sounders) made the play-offs in their first season. It was outlandish to expect anything more than that from a team typically assembled from scratch in the space of weeks. All that changed with Atlanta, though. While some teams are still waiting to break their MLS Cup duck (looking at you, New York Red Bulls), Atlanta United managed to win the title in just two seasons. Not only that, they did so having triggered a soccer awakening in the city, drawing record-breaking crowds. Now, all MLS expansion teams will, fairly or unfairly, be measured by what Tata Martino, Miguel Almiron, Josef Martinez et al achieved. FC Cincinnati, however, are so far measuring up rather well. They have lost just two of their opening five MLS fixtures, putting them in the playoff places in the Eastern Conference. They don’t have an Almiron or a Martinez, but coach Alan Koch and the FC Cincinnati front office have put together an exciting, dynamic group of players. Former Vancouver forward Kekuta Manneh has hit the ground running, US international Kenny Saief, signed on loan from Anderlecht in the off-season, is in the form of his life, while in Nick Hagglund and Greg Garza the Orange and Blue have a defensive foundation steeped in recent MLS Cup success. Garza, of course, was a championship-winner with Atlanta just last year. But it’s more than just FC Cincinnati’s on-the-field results that have caught the eye. Just as in Atlanta, a community’s passion for soccer has been roused, with a sell-out crowd of 32,250 fans recorded for FC Cincinnati’s home opener. Footage bounced around social media of the “March To The Match” which filled the streets around Nippert Stadium before kick off. The sight of thousands upon thousands of fans clad in orange and blue was so striking that some – with tongues in cheek - questioned the authenticity of the images. This couldn’t really be happening in Cincinnati, could it? Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. While Atlanta’s rise was somewhat unexpected, Cincinnati has long been hailed as a cradle of soccer in North America. Some put that down to the city’s German heritage. Others simply point to a well-run USL outfit which harnessed the local soccer community, attracting huge crowds to Nippert Stadium, years before MLS entry. Whatever the reason, MLS in Cincinnati feels right. After this season, expansion teams may have another yardstick with which to measure themselves. Teams of more modest resources may talk about ‘doing a Cincinnati’ rather than ‘doing an Atlanta’ with the move to Ohio just another indicator of MLS’s recent success in picking expansion locations. If the 2014 introduction of New York City FC and Orlando City can be considered the start of ‘Phase Three’ in the league’s development, barely a misstep has been made since then. Atlanta United, Minnesota United, Los Angeles FC, the two aforementioned teams and, of course, FC Cincinnati have all added something worthwhile to MLS, contributing to the overall prosperity of North America’s fasting-growing sports league. The process of picking an expansion location can be a fraught one. MLS is an attractive proposition right now and so the league could, if it wanted to, stretch into every market in North America. Just look at the competition for the final spot on the league’s current expansion timeline - interest has been registered, at one point or another, from groups in Charleston, Charlotte, Detroit, Las Vegas, Louisville, Oklahoma City, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego and St Louis. Not every market is right for MLS, though, and so the league must plot its route carefully. The expansion of Inter Miami will be a real test of MLS’s strategy. South Florida was, of course, previously home to an MLS franchise, but the Miami Fusion famously failed to attract the local soccer community and folded amid financial difficulty after just four seasons. Ownership issues might have been the primary cause of death for the Fusion, but Miami is notorious for being an exceptionally challenging sports market. What will Inter Miami, who will also play in Fort Lauderdale at first, do that their predecessors didn’t? Success in Miami might ease the need for MLS to be quite so forensic in its expansion plans. If the league can make it there, it can make it anywhere, or at least that would be the argument. Until then, however, new teams and new cities must be picked carefully. MLS has got things right in recent years and the sight of FC Cincinnati, a well-constructed team playing in front of sell-out crowds, is just another sign of that.",Football
"Player migration is giving cricket a worrying identity crisis We are all prisoners of our own generation and my dad was no exception. When he went into hospital to be greeted by a Nigerian nurse, he was – not having met many Nigerians – a bit nervous. “She’s lovely,” he reported next day and never worried about the subject again. But I did. Because if Britain’s hospitals are staffed by African and Asian doctors and nurses, who then is looking after patients in their own countries? The answer in some cases is no one. “Too many immigrants,” think part of the UK population (52%?). “No, there isn’t,” say others (48?). Does anyone consider the other side of the equation? Romania has lost a fifth of its population in the past 30 years, nearly all to western Europe. Sure, many send money home – but the best and brightest have gone, and the countryside is deserted. What kind of future is that for a country? The connection between that and cricket may not be obvious, but listen. In February Yorkshire signed a 26-year-old South African fast bowler called Duanne Olivier, the 43rd player to join an English county under the “Kolpak” ruling, a 2003 European Court of Justice decision that insisted free movement applied to sports teams not just within the EU but to countries that had relevant agreements with the EU – like South Africa. Most of the 43 have been players whose prospects of representing their country were slender. They were the peripheral, the past-it and the pissed-off. But Olivier is different. This winter he became South African cricket’s brightest new star – 31 wickets in five Tests – and was all set to be unleashed in the World Cup and in the series against England later this year. Not now: his contract with Yorkshire bars him from representing his country for the next three years. Furthermore he has announced he wants to spend the time qualifying for England – the ECB having just, in a characteristically wretched decision, reduced the period from seven years to three. This allows them to play Jofra Archer – who was born in Barbados but holds a British passport – in the imminent World Cup. How convenient. This subject has infinite complications. Years of mass population movements mean that many, many sports people have different nationalities in their background and thus a legitimate choice, though Olivier is not one of them. There are also multiple ironies. One is that something very similar happened in reverse in the 1980s when English cricketers were being recruited to play in rebel tours designed to bolster the apartheid state. Furthermore, Olivier is going to Yorkshire – Yorkshire! – who in the 80s still barred players born in such distant territories as Lancashire and Durham. These days, like other rich counties, they grub round the poorer ones picking off their home-grown stars like oligarchs buying London penthouses. The compensation for the losers, says one official, is “paltry”. (There is discussion about small changes but, as the official put it, “The feeling is that we should avoid the football model.” Why? Football’s much fairer.) And now Yorkshire are screwing not just other counties but one of cricket’s core nations, one where the health of the game is fundamental to the fraying fabric of cricket as we have known it. This is a new form of imperialism, akin to digging up the world’s treasures and displaying them in the British Museum. The cricket historian and administrator (and former anti-apartheid campaigner) André Odendaal identifies four reasons for South Africa’s vulnerability. One is the currency: with the rand at 19 to the £, South Africa is helpless: the cricket authorities emptied their piggy bank to offer Olivier an international contract but Yorkshire are thought to have tripled that (about £150,000 base salary). The second is opportunity: players find England a much better showcase to sell themselves as Twenty20 men and make the really big bucks. There is also a lingering sense among South African white players that they are disadvantaged by the racial quotas introduced after the abolition of apartheid, though the impact is much softer now and non-existent for someone like Olivier. And finally there are always the agents, whispering in players’ ears (“Are you happy?” “Yeah!” “No you’re not, look at the numbers.”) “It’s obviously a sign of Twenty20 and player power,” says Odendaal. “It’s more and more difficult for national bodies to control their players. This trend is a definite threat to the stability of South African cricket and to the system built up through B teams and under-19s. It’s quite unsettling.” I would put it much more strongly than that. Because so few countries play the game seriously, international cricket is extremely fragile. Already Ireland are not at the World Cup partly because the best Irish player, Eoin Morgan, is captaining England. Archer will doubtless join him. Olivier may be there in 2023. Taken to its logical conclusion, the England team ends up being as meaningful as the Bangalore Bankrollers and the Mumbai Mercenaries. Yes, the team may be stronger. But so what? If England win every game because they have stolen the top South African and West Indian players, who will want to watch? The TV rights will become worthless. (That’s the language the game’s rulers understand.) I don’t blame Olivier; I blame his new employers. His enticement away from South Africa’s team is a disgrace. And if he ever plays for England instead, it will be a scandal. • This article was amended on 2 April 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the cricket historian and administrator André Odendaal as Andrew.

"Kash Ali's boxing licence suspended after David Price biting incident Kash Ali’s boxing licence has been suspended pending a hearing, the British Boxing Board of Control has announced. Ali was disqualified for biting David Price during Saturday’s heavyweight bout and has also had his purse, estimated to be in the region of £20,000, withheld, minus expenses. The incident happened in round five when Price, 35, landed a fierce blow on the previously undefeated Ali. He reacted by forcing his opponent to the canvas where he was seen to bite the Liverpudlian, leaving a visible mark on his torso. The referee, Mark Lyson, who had earlier docked Ali a point for hitting the back of Price’s head, immediately disqualified him and awarded the victory to Price, who had been ahead on the scorecards. Ali left the M&amp;S Bank Arena under a barrage of drinks thrown by spectators and admitted shortly after the fight that he had been “stupid”. Price is still bemused by the incident, though he knows he did the right thing by avoiding further confrontation following the premature ending. He told talkSPORT: “When he was on the floor on top of me he went a bit limp and I thought ‘he doesn’t want to get up here’, I thought he’d at least try to get up. “The next thing I felt was his teeth sink in and I didn’t know what to do, really, it all happened quickly. It was just a bit of a mad experience. “When I stood up and first went over to him, part of me wanted to just lay him out there and then. I thought better of it because it would have got myself in a load of trouble and it would have caused a lot of trouble on the night. I don’t know whether it’s out of character for him or not because I’ve sparred with him quite a bit and I’ve always found him to be pretty respectful. “I just don’t know whether the buildup and the press conferences got him riled up and when he’s realised that beating me isn’t as easy as everyone seems to think, he’s thought ‘I’ll take the exit route and give him a little bite’.” In one of the few precedents in Britain, middleweight Adrian Dodson was banned for 18 months in 1999 after being found guilty of biting opponent Alain Bonnamie.",Sport
"Pie Fidelity: In Defence of British Food review – no need to scoff Pete Brown is a Barnsley-raised lad who now lives in north London and works as a food journalist. Or as he puts it, typically wry: “I may well now speak fluent ramen and conversational kimchi, but I do so with a thick fish-and-chip accent.” In Pie Fidelity, he uses this sense of personal division as the basis for a wider exploration of Britain’s food culture, which he suggests is riven along similar lines – between its historical, working-class roots and a newfangled obsession with exoticism. The foodie revolution of recent decades, Brown contends, is not just a largely middle-class phenomenon; it has also been “a reaction against traditional British food”. When people talk of Britain finally discovering its culinary mojo, what they really mean is that we’ve become better at raiding the larders of other countries. Brown wants us to be less sheepish about our homegrown victuals, which should, he says, be a source of pride. Accordingly, in Pie Fidelity, he serves up a “defence of British food” that considers the origins and present-day status of nine typical dishes. He kicks off with pie and peas – specifically, the pork pie and mushy peas from his favourite cafe in Barnsley market, which costs £2 and is served with a mug of tea. (It’s where he took his wife, Liz, on an early date.) From there, he proceeds to the cheese sandwich, fish and chips, the cream tea, the full English, roast dinner and fruit crumble. He also includes two dishes of foreign origin – curry and spag bol – whose embrace by the British has been close enough to warrant inclusion in his survey. Brown’s writing has a pleasingly loose-limbed feel: he flits easily between memoir, food history and travelogue. Most chapters open with a backward glance, as he reviews his earliest memories of the dish in question. Through such passages, we get snapshots of a northern childhood: Brown aged nine, squeezing Primula cheese on his sandwiches, which he cuts into proud diagonals; as a teenager, stopping off at the chippy after a night down the pub (“my fondest teenage snogs tasted of fish and chips”); as a student at St Andrews, making his first, startled acquaintance with curry. Such recollections, while personal, will also strike a nerve with many readers. What British person doesn’t vividly remember eating fish and chips as a child? And yet Pie Fidelity isn’t simply an exercise in nostalgia. Brown evokes the emotionalism of eating, but can also play the role of grown-up journalist. His chapters broaden into general discussions that invariably strike the right balance of chattiness and erudition – and many of their insights are genuinely revealing. In the spag bol chapter, for instance, he attempts to recreate his childhood version of the dish (a horrifying concoction of ragu sauce and tinned minced beef in gravy), only to find that it tastes nothing like he remembers. This prompts a fascinating aside on the way that canned foods have deteriorated over the decades – the result, he suggests, of endless skimping by manufacturers. And what of Brown’s assertion that the merits of British cuisine are unsung? We are, it’s true, neglectful of our culinary traditions. Yet I’m not sure he always gets his focus right: dishes such as fish and chips, or the full English, seem to be doing pretty nicely, thank you; Brown could have explored a few less well-charted byways, such as the array of stews and savoury puddings once beloved of England’s rural population. And he overstates his case at times – suggesting, for example, that pies and the like rival the best offerings of any country. If that’s true, then why has British food made so little impression (other than as a subject of ridicule) on the rest of the world? It’s not as if our dealings with other nations haven’t been extensive. Brown never really confronts this question, perhaps because the answer that his own arguments would compel him to (that foreigners are narrow-minded and judgmental) wouldn’t sit comfortably with the kimchi‑eater inside him. • Pie Fidelity: In Defence of British Food is published by Particular Books (£16.99).

"Brexit is no game. But that’s how Tories are treating the indicative votes Last week, under a process unique in a thousand years of parliamentary history, MPs had the opportunity to discover “the will of parliament”. Today it will be repeated. Instead of voting to decide between mutually exclusive proposals on Brexit, MPs had a series of indicative votes. It was supposed to break the deadlock by allowing MPs to say not only what they wanted, but what they would be prepared to accept when it comes to Brexit. Most rational people had long since realised that the prime minister’s deal would not get a majority. So the idea was that indicative votes actually gave MPs the opportunity to secure a majority for something, but only if they honestly voted for all the proposals that they could accept, instead of only voting for the one or two proposals that they most wanted. I found the experience refreshing. Normally I am clear beforehand about which single proposal in a binary choice I am going to vote for. With the indicative votes I had the chance to vote for lots of things. I didn’t have to rank them in order, I just had to say whether I could live with them. Anything I really could not accept, I could vote against. During the course of the debate I found myself changing my decision. I had originally decided to vote against the European Economic Area with a customs union proposal. It respects the referendum technically by leaving the EU, and it delivers the benefits of a customs union, but the membership of the single market means we would not have control over money, borders and laws in a way that most people who voted to leave would find unacceptable. But my colleague Lucy Powell MP made an excellent speech that made me realise that even though I did not favour it, I could live with it. So I changed my decision and did not vote against. I treated the indicative process as a mechanism to deliver an outcome that most of us could live with. Looking at the way many other MPs actually voted, that now seems almost touchingly naive. What I did not expect was that some people would vote against positions they actually supported in order to game the system and try to get their number one choice to the top of the list. I, of course, knew Anna Soubry’s top option was to have a second referendum. She does not want to leave the EU and wants to reverse the result of the referendum so of course I expected her to vote to have a second referendum on any deal and to revoke article 50. That is fair and proper. What I had not expected was that she would vote against the Clarke/Benn amendment on a customs union. She and many of her colleagues in the Independent Group are on the record as supporting a customs union, indeed they were signatories to the customs union amendments to the trade bill and the customs bill. They did not even abstain. They voted against something they had always previously supported. The public may wonder if some old scores were being settled or whether tribal loyalties were preventing some MPs from voting for options they might have favoured if only they had been put forward by a different source. On the whole I believe Labour MPs came out of the process with great credit. They entered into the spirit of the indicative process and were prepared to vote in favour of more options than any other political party or group. Personally I emerged as less amenable than most of my Labour colleagues (only voting in favour of three options and abstaining on two). But on average Labour MPs were willing to vote for four or five options out of the eight available. The most astonishing fact of the indicative vote process however, is how difficult Conservatives found it to vote in favour of anything at all. On the Guardian spreadsheet the Conservative MPs can be easily identified by the sea of red “againsts” next to their names. On average Conservatives voted against six or seven options out of the eight available, with very few abstentions. Some, such as Mel Stride and Charles Walker, could not find it in themselves even to abstain on a single option, but voted against all eight. Surely the public had a right to expect better? This was supposed to be a process in which MPs placed the interest of the country first. Where they said yes to all the things they could accept in a spirit of reasonable compromise. For some MPs it appears to have turned into a high-stakes exercise in games theory. We did not find out “the will of parliament” – what we found instead was the wilfulness of MPs. If parliament is to find a path through the Brexit mess today, then MPs need to stop playing the system, pay no attention to the names or parties of the proposer and seconders and ask themselves honestly “Could I bear to put up with this sort of deal?” Then and only then might we reclaim the right to call ourselves representatives of the will of the people. • Barry Gardiner is shadow secretary of state for international trade, energy and climate change.

"Creditors review – Strindberg lays bare the self-pitying male psyche Adolf is in the midst of a row with Tekla. In August Strindberg’s psychologically slippery play, the failing artist wants to tell his wife how much he has sacrificed for her success as a novelist and how he, the mesmerised husband, has allowed her to suck his creative juices dry, to profit at his expense. We’re reasonably certain it is a self-pitying whinge (although with Strindberg, there is always an element of doubt), and what we expect is a howl of petulant anger or even an act of violence. But James Sheldon surprises us. Instead of ranting, the actor lies down, places his head on his wife’s lap and speaks softly, playing against the vitriol in his lines. Tekla (Dorothea Myer-Bennett), who has been bottling up her fury at the barrage of patronising allegations, can do nothing but place her hands tenderly on her husband’s head. This moment in Tom Littler’s subtly acted studio production – en route to London’s Jermyn Street theatre after its Keswick debut – exemplifies the push-pull impulses of Creditors. The actors play love and hate at the same time, as unsure of themselves as we are. The scene turns them into mother and child, which is a variant on the sister-brother relationship Adolf fears they have settled into. So ineffectual is he and so bright and assured is she that flashes of adult passion are rare. It is tempting to think Strindberg, a noted misogynist, believes such infantilisation is an inevitable consequence of men relinquishing power to women. But he is too good a dramatist to hold that reductive thought for long. Besides, he also fields Tekla’s ex-husband Gustaf to muddy the waters. Gustaf poisons the mind of Adolf – an Iago to his Othello – and plays psychopathic mind games with Tekla. Played by David Sturzaker, he’s like a pick-up artist, dissembling and dangerous. Howard Brenton’s no-nonsense translation completes the “Strindberg project” that began with the biographical The Blinding Light and his 2017 version of Miss Julie, which is now being revived with an overlapping cast. It’s a neck-up sort of production, focused on the characters’ interior struggles amid the summery whites of Louie Whitemore’s set, but no less gripping for that. • At Theatre By the Lake, Keswick, until 20 April and Jermyn Street theatre, London, 26 April-1 June.",Stage
"Greens blast key part of Labor's climate policy as 'fake action' The Greens are positioning to torpedo a key element of Labor’s new climate policy in the event Bill Shorten wins the federal election in May, telegraphing strong opposition to heavy polluters using international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets. The thumbs-down from the Greens, who will likely be the critical Senate bloc post-election in the event of a Labor victory, comes as the politically influential motoring lobby has also signalled it will push back on Labor’s proposal to introduce vehicle efficiency standards for light vehicles that would bring Australia broadly into line with carbon pollutions standards for cars in the US. The Australian Industry Group, which represents some of Australia’s heavy emitters, also argued the 45% emissions target proposed by Labor would represent a “heavy lift” for many parts of the economy and “would be workable only if they were delivered in tandem with commitments to avoid trade distortions, allow many sources of flexibility and facilitate major low-carbon investments”. Labor on Monday, on budget eve and only days before the calling of the election, unveiled the final tranche of its climate policy. The policy includes more stringent pollution-reduction requirements for heavy industry, a new vehicle emissions standard imposed on car retailers, and new targets to increase the share of electric vehicles in the transport fleet. The Morrison government went on the political offensive immediately, likening the measures to a carbon “tax”. The prime minister claimed Labor’s beefed-up pollution requirements for big emitters would force companies to purchase international carbon credits, “sending money offshore to foreign carbon traders – carbon credits from Kazakhstan”. The Greens’ climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, used similar language to Morrison: “We cannot outsource our emissions reduction obligations to a pig farm in Ukraine.” Bandt said international offsets were “fake action because Australian polluters will buy overseas permits from other countries but keep polluting at home. International offsets delay climate action in Australia. More coal will be burnt at home and the transition to 100% renewables will be delayed”. Labor defended the decision to deploy permits as part of the abatement options. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the government needed to explain why it supported Australian businesses trading in international markets, but not international carbon markets. “What we need are cuts in pollution, whether they are from the Australian carbon farming sector or overseas robust credible markets or the electricity sector – the important thing is for cuts in pollution to be achieved … in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible,” Butler said. A pitched backroom lobbying campaign has prevented governments imposing vehicle emissions standards in Australia for years. The Australian Automobile Association warned on Tuesday “a poorly designed standard will drive up the cost of cars”, despite government modelling indicating vehicle efficiency standards would actually deliver billions of dollars in fuel savings for consumers. Labor has proposed a pollution regulation that will bring Australian cars in line with 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, but will consult on the timeline for phasing in the change. The AAA remains opposed to a model that would mirror standards in the European Union or the US and has successfully argued for years that the needs of Australian drivers are unique. On Monday the AAA said it supports the introduction of an emissions standard that recognises the “unique needs and preferences of Australian motorists”, but that a “poorly-designed standard” would drive up the cost of cars and petrol. The issue of vehicle efficiency standards has been politically toxic, with attempts by the current government to introduce them derailed by the National party and the motoring and petroleum lobbies. The consequence of that is Australia now lags behind the rest of the world in introducing standards that would help deal with the country’s second-highest source of emissions – the transport sector. One motor lobby, the NRMA, has taken a different position to the AAA and says Australia is so far behind it will have to look at banning internal combustion engine vehicle sales within the next decade. Labor has also proposed a national electric vehicle target of 50% of all new car sales by 2030. Other industry groups on Monday said they wanted to see more detail on how the opposition plans to implement its climate policies if it wins government in May. The Ai Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, said proposed pollution requirements for different sectors under a beefed-up safeguard mechanism would need to be achieved through low-cost abatement anywhere in the domestic economy, as well as through credible international options. He warned assisting industries exposed as a result of the transition to a low-carbon economy could be difficult when many currently weren’t defined as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries under government arrangements. Willox also said that options for low- and zero-carbon transition in industry needed to be more tangible. “The proposed Strategic Industries Fund could be useful, though important detail is lacking on coverage, level of matching and more,” Willox said. “In short, we should not underestimate how difficult the trade-offs would be between the expectations of different industries and other stakeholders. Close consultation with the breadth of affected industries would be essential to deliver on such ambitious goals.” Environment groups, meanwhile, said the package was a substantial step forward on climate but still fell short on issues including the need to replace coal-fired power and reduce deforestation. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “There is still a cognitive dissidence in our national debate about the climate damage the coal we dig up and send overseas is causing. No party can claim to be truly serious on climate change until it stops Adani and develops a strategy to accelerate the transition away from coal.” The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian said the policy had the potential “to actually reduce emissions in line with a credible and achievable emission reduction target of 45% by 2030”.",Environment
"Reiwa: how Japan's new era name is breaking tradition Reiwa – Japan’s new imperial era – adheres to the established naming custom in that it comprises two kanji characters – rei and wa – and is easy to read and write. But it also represents a break with centuries of tradition as the first era name to have been inspired by a Japanese, rather than Chinese, work of classical literature. The characters are taken from a stanza in a poem about plum blossoms that appears in Man’yoshu, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, compiled sometime after 759. Placed in that literary context, the kanji can be read to mean “fortunate” or “auspicious”, and “peace” or “harmony”. Some on social media said the name had more authoritarian overtones, noting that the first character also means “order” or “command”, and features in the Japanese words for official announcement and law. The second character also appears in Yamato, an old word for Japan that has militaristic connotations. Japan is the only country in the world that uses the era name system, or gengo, which has its roots in China, although the Gregorian calendar is also in common use. The country has adopted almost 250 eras since the gengo system began in the seventh century. In the past, emperors would change era names mid-reign to foster a spirit of renewal after natural disasters or crises, but more recently, a single era has been used to mark a monarch’s entire reign and can also be applied posthumously. Japan’s emperor during the second world war, for example, is now referred to in Japan not as Hirohito, but as the Showa emperor. The naming of a new imperial era for Japan – and for only the third time in almost a century at that – carries enormous significance. Like gengo throughout Japan’s modern history, Reiwa is supposed to reset the national mood ahead of the new emperor’s reign, which begins on 1 May. According to Japan’s prime minister, the new era should encompass pride in the country’s history and traditions along with hope for the future. The new name has also had an unexpected beneficiary: the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (REIWA), which has seen a surge in traffic to its website – most of it from Japan. The institute, whose chief executive has reportedly been interviewed by Japanese media, said on Twitter that it welcomed the new era with which it shares a name, and reminded followers that the tweet was not an April Fools’ joke. Like previous imperial eras, Reiwa will over time become closely associated with significant domestic and national events. The Meiji (enlightened rule) era of 1868 to 1912 is remembered as a period of western-inspired modernisation; the Showa era (enlightened harmony), which began in 1926, is remembered for Japan’s rapid economic development, but is also inseparable from the rise of Japanese militarism and the second world war. The three decades of Heisei evoke similarly ambivalent feelings: the period saw the end of the bubble economy and deteriorating relations with China. Many will forever associate it with the 1995 terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway, the Kobe earthquake, and the triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and consequent Fukushima meltdown of March 2011. According to a poll by Kyodo news agency, 39.8% of respondents will use both the new gengo and Gregorian calendar in daily life, with 24.3% saying they preferred the former and 34.6% the latter. Not everyone shared the generally enthusiastic reception the new era name received on Monday, with some describing it as a throwback to prewar monarchism. “Japanese society is no longer controlled by an emperor,” Hiroshi Kozen, an emeritus professor of Chinese literature at Kyoto University, told Kyodo. “The era system should reflect people’s desires, and that should start with a discussion about why we need it,” he said.",World news
"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action 1) Manchester United continue to show their forward options With Ole Gunnar Solskjær suggesting afterwards that Paul Pogba may operate deeper at times and Luke Shaw playing like a left‑back-cum-libero against Watford, this first win as the permanent manager suggests his brave new world will continue to feature a brightness of approach. Solskjær wishes to harness Pogba’s all-round ability to give more control of the ball as United are primarily a counter-attack unit. This was how Shaw opened up Javi Gracia’s impressive team with a majestic Matthias Sammer-like pass that put Marcus Rashford in to open the scoring. Before then United were poor as they were after the break until Anthony Martial’s strike proved the winner despite Abdoulaye Doucouré’s late finish. The goals from Rashford and Martial took them to 10 in the league to join Romelu Lukaku and Pogba in double digits: this has not occurred since the 1995‑96 season when Paul Scholes, Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs and Andrew Cole did the same. Jamie Jackson • Match report: Manchester United 2-1 Watford 2) Sarri does not have long left at Chelsea This is uncharted territory for Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea. Managers have endured spells of dissent from those in the stands, and open revolt – as much as dreadful results on the pitch – ended up doing for André Villas-Boas and Luiz Felipe Scolari. But no head coach has endured such a prolonged mutiny as Maurizio Sarri. His team may have won at the Cardiff City stadium, leaning on a linesman’s oversight to spark their comeback, to avoid a fifth defeat in six away games, but there are very few signs of progress in their play. It is astonishing they are still so close to the top four. Had they lost this match, Sarri’s position would surely have been untenable. As it is, he limps on into the midweek meeting with Brighton and every slack display will provoke more mutiny. It is hard to see the Sarri project extending into a second season. Even wins as dramatic as this do nothing to safeguard his future. Dominic Fifield • Match report: Cardiff 1-2 Chelsea 3) Liverpool defenders make a case for top individual prizes Awards season approaches and the Liverpool full-backs Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander‑Arnold should be on the shortlists, even if defenders no longer win the individual gongs. The last defender to win the Professional Footballers’ Association prize was John Terry in 2005. For the Football Writers’ Association award it was Steve Nicol in 1989. He might have been caught unawares by the quick free-kick that set up Lucas Moura’s equaliser, but Robertson had echoed fellow Scot and Liverpool predecessor Nicol in supplying the cross from which Roberto Firmino scored. His forays down the left caused problems for Kieran Trippier, Spurs’ right-back, in the first half but the pair’s attacking qualities tempt Jürgen Klopp to field a midfield safety blanket trio of Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Georginio Wijlnaldum in key fixtures. On this occasion, Liverpool surrendered control of midfield and almost the title race. John Brewin • Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Tottenham 4) Manchester City at full-strength for decisive April games Fulham were ideal opponents for a side preparing to play eight games in a month. Manchester City did not have to extend themselves against Scott Parker’s team and it pleased Pep Guardiola that Kevin De Bruyne was able to stroll through his first start since 2 March. De Bruyne’s season has been disrupted by injuries but the midfielder’s return from a hamstring problem has come at a good time for Guardiola, who also had the vital Fernandinho available for the first time since the Carabao Cup final on 24 February. City’s squad is looking strong – Leroy Sané did not make it off the bench at Craven Cottage – and that should serve them well as they chase the quadruple, with the FA Cup semi-final against Brighton on Saturday and the looming triple-header against Tottenham bound to stretch them. They will hope to conserve more energy when they host Cardiff on Wednesday. Jacob Steinberg • Match report: Fulham 0-2 Manchester City 5) Sissoko blames himself but must keep his head held high “I blame myself for this defeat,” said Moussa Sissoko after Liverpool’s late win. There’s no getting away from it, the Frenchman’s miss – through on goal but blazing over from 14 yards after Virgil van Dijk ushered him onto his weaker foot – was a shocker and if Liverpool go on to win the title by a point or two, this will be one of those moments that will define that triumph, in the same way Steven Gerrard’s slip and Demba Ba’s goal at the opposite end of the Anfield pitch came to define Liverpool’s title meltdown in 2014. A Sissoko goal would likely have given Spurs a 2-1 win, but instead it was Tottenham that crumbled. The 29-year-old must share some of the blame for that lack of composure but he is a big reason why Spurs are still sitting third and in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Whatever positive mental shift he made at the beginning of the season has led to him becoming one of Tottenham’s most important players. It would be a shame to see a miss like this damage his confidence long-term – Spurs will need Sissoko at his rampaging best for the run-in. Michael Butler • Liverpool 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: player ratings from Anfield 6) Leicester and Rodgers are the perfect fit right now There is no doubt Brendan Rodgers is a fine coach – anyone seeking confirmation need only ask him the time, or for directions – so his appointment as Leicester manager was entirely understandable. The squad he found at the King Power Stadium could scarcely complement his strengths and weaknesses more perfectly. He has inherited an excellent defence with an experienced goalkeeper and centre-backs, who will mitigate his organisational deficiencies, while in front of them he has a talented array of young, versatile players to improve who can only benefit from the freedom and confidence he will give them. This win was Leicester’s third in a row and, if Rodgers can refrain from indulging the hubris that saw him tinker with formation and personnel before his first game – which they lost – then he and his club are on to a very good thing. Daniel Harris • Match report: Leicester 2-0 Bournemouth 7) Pritchard can look forward to next season For Alex Pritchard it must have been especially tough to bear. The Huddersfield midfielder was outstanding in the first half against Crystal Palace on Saturday as it looked like his side’s battle to avoid the inevitable may continue for another week at least. But having suffered a relegation at Selhurst Park six years ago as a Peterborough player, the former Tottenham loanee will not have fond memories of his latest trip to south London as the 2-0 defeat and wins for Southampton and Burnley confirmed the Terriers’ fate. Yet, along with the promising striker Karlan Grant, the 25-year-old could flourish in the Championship next season if given the opportunity to play regularly in an attacking role. Huddersfield face a busy summer as they prepare to adjust to life in the second tier but could be well-equipped to mount a promotion challenge if they can hit the ground running. Ed Aarons • Match report: Crystal Palace 2-0 Huddersfield 8) Calvert-Lewin starts to show more than potential Everton played some scintillating football at West Ham and, while he was not on the scoresheet, Dominic Calvert-Lewin was integral to a free-flowing display full of speed and movement. It was the 22-year-old’s fifth consecutive start and perhaps a young career that has flickered rather than ignited is starting to gather real momentum. “He can achieve what he desires, to be the striker of Everton and score many, many goals in our blue shirt,” Marco Silva said. The Everton manager admitted Calvert-Lewin needs to be more clinical, whether in the finish or the final pass, and the point was proved a couple of times in a game they might have won by a cricket score. But his improvement is clear and that run of starts should be extended against Arsenal on Sunday. “He is enjoying it and is proving to me he deserves to play in our team,” Silva said. Nick Ames • Match report: West Ham 0-2 Everton 9) Armstrong has bounced back to show his best Stuart Armstrong was withdrawn at half-time in Southampton’s defeat at Arsenal and did not start another game for his club before departing on international duty. With Scotland he suffered humiliation in Kazakhstan and a barely adequate victory in San Marino. But on Saturday he was restored to Southampton’s starting lineup and was instrumental in a precious win over Brighton. Armstrong and Nathan Redmond were Saints’ best attackers, full of elusive movement and nice touches as Ralph Hassenhüttl’s side looked by far the more coherent and enterprising for 70 minutes. They were dynamic, too. Liverpool can expect a serious workout when they travel to St Mary’s on Friday and will need to keep a close eye on Armstrong who, like Virgil van Dijk, is another canny purchase Southampton made from Celtic. Paul Doyle • Match report: Brighton 0-1 Southampton 10) Wolves need to find more goals to reach the final Wolves could perhaps be excused for losing their concentration in this game – a Burnley free-kick routine caught out their defence as early as the second minute at Turf Moor – as they have a big week in prospect. On Tuesday they entertain Manchester United, hoping for a repeat of the victory that put them in the FA Cup semi-final against Watford that takes place on Sunday. Wolves play such a refreshing brand of open and attacking football most neutrals would like to see them lift the trophy, though merely by taking their chances Burnley issued a reminder that possession, pace and passing ability do not always win the day. Wolves could still do with a little more punch up front: their total of 38 league goals is not only the lowest in the top half of the table, it is only a single goal better than Burnley have managed in a season haunted by fears of relegation.

"Why smart people are more likely to believe fake news Did you hear about the couple who decided to name their daughter Brexit? Or the fact that the regions voting leave also happened to be the areas afflicted by mad cow disease? How about the statement that smartphone radiation is causing brain damage and widespread insanity? All these claims are false. You might think that you’d have to be stupid to believe this kind of stuff, but this is a serious misunderstanding of the way the brain works. Psychological research shows that misinformation is cleverly designed to bypass careful analytical reasoning, meaning that it can easily slip under the radar of even the most intelligent and educated people. No one is completely immune. Indeed, there is now evidence that smarter people may sometimes be even more vulnerable to certain ideas, since their greater brainpower simply allows them to rationalise their (incorrect) beliefs. Fortunately, the research also offers us some strategies to overcome those biases. Let’s begin by examining why some false claims stick. Various studies have demonstrated that many of us rarely give our full attention when reading new statements. Consider the following question, for instance: “How many animals did Moses take on to the Ark?” Norbert Schwarz at the University of Southern California has found that only around 12% of students answer correctly (none). (It was, of course, Noah’s Ark – not Moses’s.) Particularly when a statement feels “fluent” (easy to process) and familiar, we tend not to focus on the details and instead go with the gist. Unfortunately, there are many simple ways that purveyors of misinformation can tweak the presentation of their claims to increase a statement’s fluency and familiarity. One example is the use of imagery – photographs help us to visualise statements, which means they can be processed fluently – and therefore seem truer. We can see this with medical stories: people are more likely to believe a pseudoscientific claim if it has a brain scan alongside it. Perhaps the most potent way of spreading misinformation is simple repetition; the more you hear an idea, the more likely you are to believe it to be true. That’s a serious problem when a small but vocal community – of climate change deniers, say – are presented as talking heads on TV and radio. In these ways, we can begin to see how misinformation can be engineered to bypass logical thinking and critical questioning. But do intelligence and education protect us against false claims? The latest research shows it partly depends on your thinking style. Some people are “cognitive misers”, for instance: they may have a lot of brainpower that allows them to perform well in exams, but they don’t always apply it, using intuition and gut instinct rather than reflective, analytical thinking. This thinking style is commonly measured with a tool known as the “cognitive reflection test” using questions such as: “If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?” The correct answer is five, but many otherwise intelligent people say 100 – the more intuitive response. Studies from the US have revealed that people who score badly on these kinds of questions tend to be more susceptible to fake news, conspiracy theories and paranormal thinking. Those who score better, in contrast, tend to be less gullible, because they use their intelligence to analyse claims rather than relying on their gut feelings. Not all fake news is created equal, though. Some stories may be faintly ludicrous, such as the family who named their daughter Brexit – whatever your background, you don’t need to believe it for it to support your worldview. But other stories may fit with your political identity far more tightly. And for these particularly emotive claims, intelligence and education may actually make you more susceptible to fake news, through a process called “motivated reasoning”. Consider the “birther” theory that Barack Obama was not born in the US. This has been debunked time and time again, but it became highly ingrained in many people’s political ideology. And greater brainpower did not prevent them from believing the story; indeed, it actually increased their credulity. A study by Ashley Jardina at Duke University in North Carolina, for instance, surveyed the views of the more conservative white Republicans – the kind of people who might have found the former president most alienating. It found that beliefs in the birther theory were strongest among the participants with the greatest political knowledge. A similar pattern could be seen with the beliefs that Obama was a Muslim, and the claims that his healthcare reforms would lead to “death panels” that decided who lived or died. To make matters worse, more educated participants also seemed less likely to update their beliefs after they had been debunked; instead, they actually became more certain they were right. Somehow, their greater knowledge simply allowed them to dismiss the new information and harden their attitudes. So far, the studies of motivated reasoning have centred on the US. But given these findings, I would be willing to bet that the same processes are shaping British responses to Brexit. For any issue that strikes at the core of who we are, greater brainpower may simply serve to preserve that identity at the expense of the truth. This new understanding of misinformation should change the way we go about debunking falsehoods. In the past, the assumption was that you could present people with the facts and they would eventually sink in. Instead, some experts studying misinformation now favour a form of “inoculation”. One of the most compelling demonstrations comes from John Cook at George Mason University and Stephan Lewandowsky at the University of Bristol. Their aim was to find a way to protect people from common misinformation about climate change – including the fake petitions that show widespread disagreement among scientists about the true causes of global warming. Rather than tackling the claims head on, Cook and Lewandowsky first showed the participants a report on the tobacco industry’s previous attempts to spread misinformation, which also included the use of fake experts to cast doubt on the scientific research that linked smoking to lung cancer. The strategy worked a treat. Having read about the tobacco industry’s tactics, the participants were more sceptical of the climate change petitions. Crucially this was true even of the more rightwing participants, who would have been naturally more inclined towards climate denialism. Given the sheer prevalence of misinformation around us, I believe that ways of identifying misinformation, combined with critical thinking, should now be taught in every school. After all, it’s not just the fake political news that we need to avoid, but health scams and financial fraud. A firmer grounding in sceptical reasoning could help everyone – whatever their IQ – to use their intelligence to make wiser judgments. • David Robson’s The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things and How to Make Wiser Decisions is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (£20).

"Streaming: a King for all seasons Another year, another film drawn from a Stephen King story: the King adaptation is a sub-genre that now encompasses more than 100 titles, running the gamut from disposable hackwork to cast-iron classics. The second film version of his peculiarly spelled shockfest Pet Sematary is out next week, and the jury’s still out on which group it will join – though it does seem a good occasion to trawl through the vast, bloody sea of King-related streaming options for the true keepers. A few are obvious: Stanley Kubrick’s deathlessly haunting interpretation of The Shining (available on iTunes), of course, or the still-bracing sexual politics and adolescent ache of Brian De Palma’s Carrie (on Netflix). (Forget the crummy remake.) The same goes for the “serious” King standards, with their varnish of non-horror respectability: The Shawshank Redemption (Amazon Prime) is still rated the greatest film of all time by IMDb users (I can’t say I’m with them, reliably heart-stirring as it is), while Stand By Me (on Now TV) remains one of Hollywood’s most wistfully executed coming-of-age tales – if it feels over-familiar by this point, blame its legions of inferior imitators. Move beyond those, however, and dozens of King-based curiosities and B-movies walk a more divisive line between trash and treasure. David Cronenberg’s The Dead Zone (on Amazon’s Starz channel) remains undervalued, with its graceful melding of the director’s signature body-horror fixations and the author’s less kinky sense of the uncanny. Despite being a brand unto himself, King’s writing can weather a strong auteurist vision. It’s a bit surprising that horror movie maestro George A Romero didn’t imprint himself more strongly on his one feature-length King adaptation, the ludicrous but shivery The Dark Half (Amazon Prime again), in which an author’s retired nom de plume comes back to haunt him. A restrained affair by both men’s standards, it was dismissed in 1993 but merits reconsideration. A jauntier collaboration between the two was Creepshow (streaming on Chili), a King-scripted anthology film paying affectionate homage to spooky DC comic books of the 1950s. Intended in 1982 to be equal parts quaint and macabre, it has held up better than some more straight-faced King outings. The 1980s were, of course, the best decade for primo King-derived schlock. Revolving around a deranged, vengeful dog and a deranged, vengeful car respectively, Cujo and Christine (both on Amazon) make for a juicily absurd double feature, the latter getting a lift from John Carpenter’s directorial vigour. Add the original, gaudily effective 1989 version of Pet Sematary (via Now TV), and it’s a party. With almost all King adaptations, down to the outright crud of The Lawnmower Man or Cell – available to stream somewhere or other – it’s a shame that one of the best 21st-century additions to the fold, Frank Darabont’s relatively subtle, unsettling monster movie The Mist, isn’t among them. It’s been overshadowed, it seems, by Netflix’s sluggish miniseries version, though the streaming giant did far better in 2017 with Gerald’s Game, an anxious, glass-brittle psychothriller based on a tricky, internal novel, with a superb Carla Gugino in the lead. Watch it with Dolores Claiborne (harder to find than some, but on iTunes), the other great, underseen and very adult King adaptation for the genre-agnostic – in which Kathy Bates (above), having already won an Oscar as a lunatic fan in the cheerfully grisly (and Netflixable) King thriller Misery, comprehensively outdid herself as a more ambiguously soured, windblown murder suspect. Indeed, those two performances are as good a measure as any of the tonal range covered by the author’s oeuvre on screen: though his name connotes a particular kind of terror, there’s a Stephen King film in the pile for just about anybody. Also new on DVD and streaming The Old Man and the Gun (Fox, 12) Starring an ideally matched Robert Redford and Sissy Spacek, this mellow, melancholic autumn-years crime caper goes down like aged bourbon. Ralph Breaks the Internet (Disney, PG) Disney doubles down on the clever-clever techno-comedy of Wreck-It Ralph, with bright, exhausting results slathered in corporate self-branding. An Impossible Love (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) French director Catherine Corsini’s mother-daughter melodrama is an absorbing slow-burner, before emerging as a wrenching trauma study. Detour (Sony, PG) Edgar G Ulmer’s supremely slinky 1945 B-movie gets A-grade treatment from the Criterion Collection, its nasty pleasures polished and intact. Annihilation (Paramount, 15) Non-Netflix subscribers finally have a chance to watch last year’s most essential sci-fi vision on DVD/Blu-ray. Alex Garland wraps rich ideas in cool, steely beauty. Assassination Nation (Universal, 18) A Sundance phenomenon that ultimately fizzled in cinemas, this vibrant, abrasive, uneven #MeToo-era update of the Salem witch trials may yet build a cult.",Film
"Remainers, take note: much of Europe just wants to excise the British cancer The mood in Brussels is pessimistic. Most of those closely involved in the Brexit talks think the likeliest outcome is for the UK to leave without a deal. There is also tremendous frustration with what EU officials see as the incompetence, ignorance and irresponsibility of swaths of the British political class. Over the past three years much of the goodwill that people held towards the UK has evaporated. The EU expects no deal because it does not trust British politicians not to screw up. There is not much faith that “indicative votes” among MPs will produce a coherent way forward. “We don’t see the transmission mechanism that forces the executive to bend to parliament’s will,” said one EU official. “We cannot negotiate with a parliament.” Another source of Brussels’ pessimism is the apparent inability of British politicians – including Labour’s leaders – to recognise how much the EU cares about the European elections. Assuming that parliament does not pass Theresa May’s deal, the EU will not extend article 50 – and thus prevent a no-deal Brexit on 12 April – unless the UK agrees to take part in European elections. If Britain remained a member while skipping the elections, not only British citizens but those from other member-states living in the UK would be disenfranchised. Somebody would go to the European court of justice, arguing that the parliament was improperly constituted and that its decisions – such as the appointment of the new European commission – were flawed. Many governments would rather the UK left without a deal than breach treaty provisions on elections. The growing talk in London of a general election disturbs Brussels. In the midst of a confusing general election campaign, will there be an executive capable of requesting an extension of article 50 and organising European elections? And what if the outcome is a government led by someone like Boris Johnson, which picks fights with the EU in order to provoke a no-deal situation, or messes up the negotiation of the future relationship? However fed up they are with the British, most EU governments hope to avoid no deal, but they differ over how far they should go to avoid it. Those member states closest to the UK – Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and above all Ireland – would take the biggest economic hit. And some EU leaders understand that no deal would damage the EU’s international standing. There are tensions between Germany and France. Angela Merkel fears the geopolitical consequences of an estrangement between the UK and the EU27; it would weaken the west just when it was facing severe challenges from illiberal forces in Russia, China and the US. The Germans worry that an acrimonious Brexit would preclude a close future relationship between the British and the EU. The French, uniquely among the 27, are ambivalent over Brexit, seeing opportunities as well as costs. Emmanuel Macron is focused on his European election battle against Marine Le Pen and fears that she will gain if Brexit lingers unresolved. He wants to demonstrate that leaving the EU carries significant costs. There is also some tension between Brussels and Dublin, because the Irish government has not spelled out what would happen at their border with Northern Ireland in the event of no deal. According to one Brussels official: “If the Irish do not introduce checks, the French and others will insist on controls between the continent and Ireland.” However, both Dublin and the commission agree that the way around this difficulty is for the EU to refuse to talk to the British about measures to mitigate no deal unless they adopt something like the Irish backstop (in addition to paying the money they owe and protecting citizens’ rights). Remainers should not assume that everyone in the EU wants another British referendum. Many senior figures worry that if the UK prevaricates or stays it will distract the EU from other pressing challenges, contaminate European politics with its weird Eurosceptic attitudes and block further integration. Key officials despair at the inability of many leading British commentators and politicians to learn about how the EU works or what it wants from the negotiations. For example, senior MPs such as Nicky Morgan and Damian Green have wasted everyone’s time by backing the “Malthouse compromise” – whereby the UK would reject the withdrawal agreement but ask for a three-year transition, to mitigate the worst effects of no deal – although it is clearly incompatible with the EU’s objectives. Donald Tusk, the European council president, is at one end of the spectrum in arguing that doors should be left open to the UK, lest it reconsider Brexit. The Dutch, Germans, Irish, Poles and Swedes lean in that direction. But many other governments, and senior figures in the commission, are keen to excise the British cancer from the European body politic. • Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform",Opinion
"The Parade by Dave Eggers review – nation-building parable by numbers The assignment for the pair of company contractors, Four and Nine, at the centre of The Parade is straightforward: to pave and paint a 230km highway that connects the northern capital with the rural south of a developing nation rebuilding after a decade of civil war. A hi-tech marvel, the paving vehicle spreads lustrously smooth asphalt along a straight route through the dusty, wreckage-strewn landscape. Forging a path through the ethical badlands of western assistance and intervention, this short novel by former literary wunderkind Dave Eggers is reminiscent of a smartly engineered machine. If Eggers roared on to the literary scene with the ebullient maximalism of his memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, his style has been pared, nearly 20 years on, to a Hemingway-like concision. The continuity in his books comes from the critical eye he turns upon American social injustice and the power his country wields on the global stage. With protagonists ranging from a Syrian-American who rescues Katrina survivors in Zeitoun to the Yemeni immigrant who builds a coffee-growing empire in The Monk of Mokha, Eggers’s nonfiction complements his activism, calculated to nudge the political dial leftwards. Meanwhile, his fiction, notably the Silicon Valley tech dystopia of The Circle, highlights perils spawned in the US. We join Four as he meets Nine – such numerical pseudonyms minimise the risk of kidnapping – at their hotel on the first morning of their 12-day job. The division of labour is clear: Four operates the RS-90 paving machine, while Nine motors ahead in a quad to “mitigate obstacles”, whether a rut or a herd of cattle. Dubbed “the Clock”, because he is a stickler for regulations and completes jobs ahead of schedule, Four is alarmed by the grandiloquent, floppy-haired Nine and his zest for necking moonshine, meeting prostitutes and sampling street food: “In an instant he knew that Nine was an agent of chaos.” While Four parrots the modernising credo of the company – “The remote areas of the south would leap a hundred years in a matter of months” – Nine gets into farcical scrapes with locals. As the president plans a parade to celebrate the armistice, the highway must be finished on schedule, so Four quivers with homicidal rage when Nine’s disregard for procedure throws the project into disarray. Since the host country remains unidentified, it seems that The Parade is not just the tale of one botched 21st-century western intervention but all of them. While the contractors are very different characters – one a corporate drudge, the other a romantic adventurer – both are archetypes of the blinkered foreigner. Eggers’s stylistic genius remains in evidence: the plot seems powered by Four’s functionalism, but his concise description of the terrain sometimes emits a lovely shimmer, as if reflecting Nine’s sense of wonder (“Silver corkscrew plumes rose from small fires”). Still, The Parade’s whiplash ending raises a question: who exactly is this parable supposed to enlighten? Few can have remained gung-ho about wading into foreign civil wars since the geopolitical quagmires of Bosnia and Afghanistan. So while Eggers is correct to zero in on unforeseen repercussions, his warning comes 20 years too late. Moreover, even the doughtiest non-interventionist may turn the final page only to wonder how, in the absence of help from outside agencies, can a highway across a poor, war-ravaged nation get built? Scarcely longer than a novella, Eggers’s story is too cramped to allow such an exploration of ideas. The Parade conjures a dystopian near-future curiously behind the times. Even if Eggers’s heart is in the right place, his book has few answers for a world on the brink. • The Parade by Dave Eggers is published by Hamish Hamilton (£14.99).

"TV comic leads first round of Ukraine's presidential election The actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy has taken a commanding lead in the first round of the Ukraine’s presidential elections, early results have shown. With just over half of the ballots counted early on Monday, Zelenskiy had 30.2% of the votes. The incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, was in a distant second place with 16.6% followed by former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko on 13%, the national elections commission said. The results were closely in line with a major exit poll. The final results were expected to be announced later on Monday. With no one expected to secure a majority, a runoff with the leading two candidates will be held on 21 April. As the results of exit polling were announced, a cheer erupted at Zelenskiy’s headquarters in a sleek lounge in Kyiv. The candidate was mobbed as he made his way to a stage to say thank you to his supporters. The vote could see a comedy actor with no political experience move a step closer to becoming the country’s next president. Zelenskiy, who plays the president in the television series Servant of the People, had been the favourite to win Sunday’s vote in a rebuke of the country’s leadership. He leads Poroshenko, the incumbent who made a fortune from his chocolate empire, and Tymoshenko, the former prime minister running as an anti-corruption firebrand. As Sunday’s exit polls were released, Poroshenko and Zelenskiy’s campaigns quickly went on the attack. “I am going to destroy him,” Mikhail Fyodorov, Zelenskiy’s head of digital strategy, said of Poroshenko. “He’s a marauder.” Poroshenko, speaking to supporters in Kyiv, said that he understood that Ukrainians were frustrated but called on them not to support Zelenskiy. “Fate has pitted me against Kolomoisky’s puppet,” declared Poroshenko, referring to a Ukrainian oligarch who has business dealings with Zelenskiy. “And we won’t give Kolomoisky a single chance.” Tymoshenko released some exit polls that showed she had taken second place and called on her supporters to be vigilant against voter fraud. “I call not to accept exit polls as the final truth,” Tymoshenko said, saying the polls had been “manipulated”. “I ask you to go to the polling stations and defend the result down to the last one ... Fighting for each protocol,” said Tymoshenko. Polling stations across the country had opened at 8am, sometimes with spreads of ham and cheese laid out for voters. Some of the people manning the polls began the day with rousing renditions of the national anthem while other Ukrainians congratulated each other about the “holiday of democracy”. Others seemed daunted by the task of voting. Thirty-nine candidates were taking part in the first-round elections and the ballot was as long as two arms outstretched. “It’s just a circus,” muttered one man looking over two tables covered with one-page biographies of the candidates. Zelenskiy’s dark horse campaign is largely counting on high turnout among younger voters eager for change in the country and disappointed with stalled reforms and a sluggish economy. Five years ago, Ukrainians overthrew their president in anti-corruption street protests. Many feel that the promises of the revolution have not been fulfilled. “I was on the Maidan [Kyiv’s central square] because I wanted something different for myself and now for my daughter,” said Maria Tischenko, a consultant, who went to a local school to vote with her husband, Svyatoslav, and three-year-old daughter. “I haven’t seen anything real change and I do think that [Zelenskiy] is a fresh face at least.” “I know he doesn’t have much experience but that is not the most important factor,” said her husband. “The professional politicians are corrupt.” Others said Zelenskiy’s lack of experience would endanger a country facing a war against Russian-backed separatists in the south-east. “It’s not the time to be choosing a comedian to be president and it’s not a joke, it is really dangerous,” said Mykhailo, 48, who declined to give his surname. He said he had voted for Poroshenko: “He isn’t given enough credit for the things he has done well. He is leading us through a war.” The highly contested campaign has sparked fears of vote-buying and other tricks at the polls. Police reported several hundred violations by 1pm on Sunday but there were no reports of major falsifications or violence at the polls by early afternoon. Typically the most fraught moments come later in the evening, when the votes are tallied. Zelenskiy’s campaign has embraced its reputation as unorthodox, holding comedy shows rather than traditional rallies and eschewing regular interviews with press. On Sunday, it opened its headquarters in a Kyiv lounge blasting music and advertising a ping-pong tournament with a chance to play Zelenskiy as the prize. Sviatoslav Yurash, 23, an adviser to the campaign, said the campaign was confident of a first-round victory based on widespread disappointment with the president. “The basic message that everyone is tired of the political elite is popular with all age categories, not just young people,” he said. He added that he wanted to see Poroshenko knocked out in the first round. “I am extremely disappointed,” he said. “I would like to see Poroshenko disgraced and not enter the second round.”",World news
"Coalition says Labor climate policy 'a Trojan horse for a carbon tax' – as it happened We are going to shut down a little early today, because parliament isn’t sitting, and we’ll be back at the crack of dawn (it will seriously be the crack of dawn) tomorrow for the Unicorn Budget shenanigans. Make sure you check back early tomorrow, because it’s going to be a pretty insane day. Parliament is also going to be sitting, so make sure you have your support mechanism of choice nearby. A big thank you to Mike Bowers for dragging me across the Mondayitis line for today, as well as Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp for all they do. Tomorrow, most of the Guardian brains trust will be in the office to help us through the day, and you are in for a treat with Chris Knaus coming in as your guest blogger while I descend the earth’s crust into hell, which is also known as the budget lock-up. My tip for this Unicorn Budget as we slide towards election eve? Big spending in Victoria and Queensland, the problem states. But we don’t have too much longer to wait to find out just how much money is to be splashed around. In the meantime, thank you to everyone who followed along – we have missed you, so it was lovely to have you all back. For those on Instagram, @pyjamapolitics will be back, with Bowers making his usual appearances during the day. Rest up tonight. And, as always, take care of you. This is something which is also happening – as reported by Katharine Murphy: The Morrison government will use Tuesday’s budget to allow 65 and 66 year olds to make voluntary superannuation contributions without meeting the current work test. The proposal, to take effect from 2020-21, is part of the government’s efforts to court older voters ahead of the looming federal election, and potentially benefits 55,000 people. The same cohort will be permitted to make three years’ worth of non-concessional contributions, which are currently capped at $100,000 a year, to their super accounts in one year. At the moment, only people under 65 can access those arrangements. The government also intends to increase the age limit for spousal contributions from 69, where it is currently, to 74. At the moment, people aged over 70 can’t receive contributions made by someone else on their behalf. The Morrison government is hoping Tuesday night’s budget – which will contain tax cuts, cash payments and a significant infrastructure spend – will revive its political fortunes ahead of the election, which is widely tipped to be called this weekend. In case you missed it, Helen Davidson and Christopher Knaus have reported on the auditor general’s decision to look into the awarding of the Paladin contract. From their report: The auditor general is expanding its inquiry into the government’s controversial deal with Paladin to cover all offshore processing contracts, after a string of revelations about the way it has handed taxpayers’ money to companies working on Manus Island and Nauru. In February, Labor referred the $423m Paladin contract to the auditor general to investigate why the Department of Home Affairs chose the “inexperienced and unknown company” to take over garrison services on Manus Island following the closure of the detention centre. On Monday, the auditor general agreed to expand its investigation and assess “whether the Department of Home Affairs has appropriately managed the procurement of garrison support and welfare services” for all of its immigration processing centres. The audit, entitled The Department of Home Affairs’ procurement of garrison support and welfare services, is forecast to deliver its report in January 2020.” That follows the recent decision of the auditor general to also look into the community sports program after the Liberal party’s Mayo candidate, Georgina Downer, awarded a giant novelty cheque with her face on it to a local group. Remember how the government announced a $6.7m grant to the Australian National Maritime museum to fund a circumnavigation of Australia to commemorate the 250th anniversary of James Cook’s landing in (what became) Australia? And remember how Scott Morrison originally called it a “re-enactment” and then had to backtrack because of the pesky detail that Cook never actually circumnavigated Australia, but just sort of charted the east coast, recorded some snarky messages in his log and then bounced? Well, recreating this government’s favoured parts of history, whether they actually happened or not, is set to continue, according to Christopher Pyne’s latest release: The Government is pleased to announce the STS Young Endeavour replacement project is progressing and will be due for consideration by Cabinet later this year. Minister for Defence, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP said the program is recognised internationally as a leading youth development program, with more than 500 young Australians taking part every year. “More than 13,600 young Australians have participated in the scheme since January 1988,” Minister Pyne said. “After 31 years of dedicated service the Young Endeavour is now approaching the end of her operational life and this project will deliver a new vessel by late 2023. “The search for a new design is progressing and once selected, the new vessel will be built in Australia”, Minister Pyne said. Just again, for the people at the back, the PBO reports our ageing population will cost the budget more than Medicare. Since 2011 – when the first of the baby boomer generation turned 65 – the share of the population of retirement age has increased significantly and the share of the population of prime working age has begun to fall. This flows through to the budget in the form of a reduction in revenue, due to lower labour force participation, and an increase in spending, reflecting greater demand for government programs that support older Australians. Over the next decade, the ageing population is projected to subtract 0.4 percentage points from the annual real growth in revenue and add 0.3 percentage points to the annual real growth in spending. In real dollar terms, this equates to an annual cost to the budget of around $36 billion by 2028–29. This is larger than the projected cost of Medicare in that same year.” How much planning do you think we have actually done for that? The Parliamentary Budget Office has released a report on the cost of Australia’s ageing population. It makes for dire reading. Part of the overview is below, but in short: “In real dollar terms, this equates to an annual cost to the budget of around $36 billion by 2028–29. This is larger than the projected cost of Medicare in that same year.” The effects of ageing will be felt more over the coming decade than in the past due to the impact of the baby boomer generation retiring. This change has already begun to detract from economic growth, after decades of providing a boost to growth. Ageing will reduce tax revenue and add to spending pressures… Since 2011 – when the first of the baby boomer generation turned 65 – the share of the population of retirement age has increased significantly and the share of the population of prime working age has begun to fall. This flows through to the budget in the form of a reduction in revenue, due to lower labour force participation, and an increase in spending, reflecting greater demand for government programs that support older Australians. Over the next decade, the ageing population is projected to subtract 0.4 percentage points from the annual real growth in revenue and add 0.3 percentage points to the annual real growth in spending. In real dollar terms, this equates to an annual cost to the budget of around $36 billion by 2028–29. This is larger than the projected cost of Medicare in that same year. …with the budget impact coming in waves. The workforce participation and Age Pension impacts of the baby boomer generation reaching retirement age are already evident and are likely to peak during the next decade. The impacts on health and aged care spending will increase more gradually and peak later, as baby boomers move into their 70s and 80s. Demand for health services typically starts to increase when individuals are in their 70s, and demand for aged care services when they are in their 80s. Expectations of Australians around increases in the quality of health and aged care services could further increase these costs.” And it ends. Main takeaways? Labor’s policy is a carbon tax, even though it builds from a Malcolm Turnbull plan, and is not at all a carbon tax. We are doing things, and they are great things. Your face is. Will the Coalition still use the Kyoto carryover credits if the United Nations determines they shouldn’t be used? Melissa Price: “We believe we are entitled to use the carryover credits.” Melissa Price is no longer talking. She is nodding like a trooper though. Angus Taylor just had this exchange with the Sydney Morning Herald’s David Crowe: Crowe: You call this a carbon tax, if this is a carbon tax is your safeguard mechanism a carbon tax also? Taylor: It is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the safeguard mechanism was meant to do. The intention is to deal with heavy polluters. That has been the policy, it is working and we are committed to 22 and reviewing that. Crowe: This policy deals with heavy polluters, how can you call it a tax when this is the number of companies being affected? Taylor: The target is completely different, what drives the outcomes here is the target. When you have a 45% emission reduction target, you are demanding almost half, half the emissions go. And that is going to cost a lot, we see independent modelling telling us the impact of that, $9,000 a year for the average Australian worker, 360,000 jobs or more, assuming the carryover is used. If you set a target like this, that’s the outcome, they are using the safeguard as a Trojan horse for a carbon tax. Shhhhhhhh. Be very, very quiet. The Melissa Price environment minister is speaking. We don’t want to startle her. I’ve just come back from a whirlwind trip to Queensland (the greatest nation on earth) and I can tell you the Coalition are W-O-R-R-I-E-D. The big election story is in Victoria this year, at least at this stage, but in Queensland, the state that held in 2016, things are looking a bit wobbly. One of the seats on the bubble is Ross Vasta’s seat of Bonner. Which makes this email blast from Australian Christian Lobby head Wendy Francis verrrrrrry interesting: Dear ACL friends I have worked with ACL now for 9 years and I am well placed to know the DNA of this organisation. We do not support one political party over another. That being said, I believe that the upcoming federal election is the most important in my lifetime and there are huge ramifications associated with the outcome. To educate voters I have been asking the following three questions of candidates and sitting members. Abortion What is your response to the news that the ALP will use federal funding to ensure free abortions are offered in public hospitals even to full term? Freedom of belief Do you believe that schools, Bible colleges, and religious institutions should be forced to employ people who fundamentally disagree with their beliefs? Gender Do you agree with States being required to remove gender from all documents such as birth certificates, drivers licenses, social security forms? In your electorate of Bonner, your sitting member, Ross Vasta, has a voting record which aligns with Truth on all of these issues and many others. He has asked me if there would be any of our supporters who would be prepared to support him by placing one of his signs in their yard. I pass this on for your consideration. If you would be happy to assist him with this request can you please contact his office at ross.vasta.mp@aph.gov.au I know he would be very grateful. Please pray for our nation. Kind regards, Wendy *extreme David Attenborough voice* It is a very rare sighting of the Melissa Price environment minister in the open. The Price environment minister usually does press conferences on the run, if at all. We’re excited to see her not only standing still, but attempting to communicate. This was just announced: Minister for the Environment, Melissa Price, and Minister for Energy, Angus Taylor, will hold a doorstop to discuss Labor’s economy wrecking climate announcement.” I wonder what their take will be? The media alert is so ambiguous. Mike Bowers has been out and about this morning: Which reminds me – we have officially entered Australian politicians and would-be politicians looking at things season: It’s always the summer of 69 in some people’s hearts. It is a cast of thousands for Labor’s official climate announcement (which is being held at an electric vehicle charging station in Civic, in Canberra’s centre). Mark Butler, Anthony Albanese, Kim Carr, Pat Conroy and (candidate) Alicia Payne have joined Bill Shorten: First of all – what is the cost of not taking action on climate change? It is huge. It was estimated that last year $18bn is the cost of the extreme weather events we’ve been having in insurance, in property values, in damage, in lost production. There is a huge opportunity cost when we don’t take action. We’re confident by the sensible, evidence-based, pragmatic and consultative policies we’re putting forward, that we can protect traditional jobs in steel, in cement, in aluminium. Industries I’ve spent my working life representing blue-collar workers in. I’m confident that with our fund to work with emissions intensive trade sectors like that, we can make sure that the changes for them are done in a way which protects those jobs. But I’m ambitious for new jobs in Australia. I don’t want us just to be ... financial service vendors or casualised part time workers. I want us to have full-time jobs in renewable energy. We have the best scientists in the world, so why on earth aren’t we adding that to value-added manufacturing? We have some of the best resources of lithium in the world. We can put together ... in Australia, we have all of the parts for a lithium battery. So why can’t we be a nation that says we want to step up and have more manufacturing jobs? In terms of electricity, we see that under this current government, even in the last three years since they got elected the second time around, the price has gone up 20%. I don’t know if it was you, Mark [Butler], or someone observed yesterday, who observed yesterday, that this $1.45 a week for pensioners, a one-off payment, a total of $75. It’s like a very small refund for their failure to do anything on energy policy in the last three years. I have no doubt that we will put downward pressure on energy prices.” You are going to hear a lot about Queensland’s land clearing laws in the next few weeks – because that is essentially what Labor is talking about when it says it’s an area it wants to tackle. So, in a nutshell, what are they? Well, in 2004, the then Labor Queensland state government passed laws which added a lot more bureaucracy for farmers who wanted to clear land. Basically, they had to get permission from the department before they could move forward. Landowners complained the process was too onerous and delayed, and they were unable to prepare for fire season and natural disasters. So when Campbell Newman’s LNP government came in, they scrapped the laws and gave the landowners the power to make their own decisions (essentially). And then land clearing went a bit nuts. The rate of excessive tree clearing in Queensland has skyrocketed, reaching an alarming rate of 395,000 hectares in 2015-16, according to the annual deforestation report released today. The 2015-16 Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) also showed the rate of tree-clearing in the Great Barrier Reef catchments had soared by almost 50 per cent since 2012-2013. The Palaszczuk Labor government attempted to change the laws after winning the 2015 election, but without majority numbers, failed. So they brought the laws back after the 2017 election when, with a majority, they passed (but not without a fight – the committee looking at the bill received 13,000 submissions, the most any Queensland government committee has ever received). So land clearing in Queensland, in a lot of cases, needs oversight once again. Farmers are still annoyed. Very annoyed. Environmental groups think the laws are better, but still have massive loopholes. So no one is completely satisfied. And as federal Labor looks to move forward with similar laws from a national standpoint, you’ll hear a lot more from all sides. Senator Tim Storer has released a proposed integrity package in the last sitting week of parliament. Storer is up for re-election and although he came in on the Nick Xenophon/Centre Alliance ticket he has since gone independent, a tough path to re-election, meaning this week is likely to be his last. I’ve done some poking around and while the proposal – which will come before the Senate in the form of a motion – has some support on the crossbench, there are a few planks that go too far for Labor. Those include the proposed overhaul of lobbyist rules, binding standards for parliamentarians expected to mirror the ministerial standards and a parliamentary integrity commissioner. Here is the full proposal: National Integrity Commission – Establish an independent National Integrity Commission to oversee the activities of public officials and empowered to conduct public hearings and make public findings of fact Real-time disclosure of political donations above $1,000 – Amend political donation laws to require disclosure of donations above $1,000 by recipients in as close to ‘real-time’ as practical Enhanced freedom of information arrangements – Boost funding to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and FOI units within departments and agencies and improve FOI review processing times Enhanced whistleblower protections – Further consolidate the whistleblower protection regime and enhance existing whistleblower protections Overhaul lobbyist rules – Legislate lobbying code of conduct and require lobbyists to disclose who they meet with and the subject matter of their meeting on a monthly basis. Expand lobbyist register to include in-house lobbyists Conduct standards for parliamentarians – Develop a Statement of Parliamentarian Standards, modelled on the Statement of Ministerial Standards, applicable to all parliamentarians Parliamentary Integrity Commissioner – Establish an independent Parliamentary Integrity Commissioner, empowered to enforce standards of parliamentary conduct, oversee interest disclosure requirements and deal with allegations of misuse of public funds, blatant falsehoods in political advertising, and breaches of lobbyist rules. On Saturday the Morrison government announced strict new laws to crack down on social media companies which fail to remove violent content quickly enough. Creating criminal offences for failure to remove content would include penalties including fines and jail terms. A spokesman for the attorney general, Christian Porter, told Guardian Australia the government would “certainly be introducing [it] this week with [a] view to having it dealt with in both houses”. So it’s a top priority – just like the big rush to increase penalties for putting needles in strawberries. Trouble is, Labor hasn’t seen the legislation yet (and nor have we, for that matter). Labor is now warning this is a “ridiculous timetable”. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus: Labor is committed to holding the social media companies to account – they can, and they must do better. What happened following the Christchurch attack can never happen again. Despite repeated requests, the government is yet to provide draft legislation regarding proposed social media regulation to the Opposition for scrutiny. If the government wishes to make this legislation law this sitting week, it will need to pass both the House and the Senate by end of day Wednesday. This ridiculous timetable is a direct result of the government being too frightened to hold an adequate number of parliamentary sitting days before the election. Once the legislation is received, Labor will scrutinise it thoroughly and provide further comment. There is no budget tree this year (even though winter has arrived ALREADY despite only just being April and if you think I am struggling dealing with it now, watch this little Queensland duck absolutely lose it in about six weeks’ time when she’s chipping ice off her windshield with her numberplate in the pitch dark) so our intrepid photographers and visual artists are having to find their own flame notes. Mike Bowers found this one: The Nationals have found another “big stick”. Probably because the last big stick suffered from a little bit of deflation and ended up being less of a big stick and more of a modestly sized toothpick. (That was the threat to break up electricity companies.) David Littleproud is not ready to let go of big sticks just yet though. So he has come up with this (from his statement) – warning, it includes an offer of flowers: Labor’s new land-clearing laws are a big stick to bash farmers when they should be rewarded for the biodiversity on their properties, minister for agriculture David Littleproud said today. Labor has announced it will extend Queensland-style land-clearing laws all over the country. The laws punish farmers for managing vegetation rather than rewarding them for the vegetation on their land. Queensland farmers have staged huge protests, given they are having large parts of their properties made unproductive without any compensation or financial reward. ‘Labor needs to come clean on what carbon gain it has modelled from banning vegetation management nationwide,’ Minister Littleproud said. ‘If Labor is getting carbon gains from stopping farmers making money on part of their farms then it should pay compensation. Labor should not take something from our farmers for nothing. If farmers are doing the heavy lifting for Labor’s carbon target, they deserve to be paid. ‘Taking away part of a business’s assets and offering nothing in return is wrong. Labor has no right to declare farmers can’t use a big part of their farms without compensation. ‘Labor wants to bash farmers with a big stick but I want to give them a bouquet.’ There is just so much wrong with that line, I am honestly at a loss of where to start. Sigh. Someone spent a lot of time coming up with this line, and it probably got an uptick in their group chat, so here you go: What we’ve got here is a re-Rudd of failed policy that cost jobs, that costs businesses, that will cost Australians at least $9,000 a year with the reckless targets that Bill Shorten will make law. That’s another way Scott Morrison is leading this attack. “Re-Rudd”. I know Bill Shorten is going to come up with equally ridiculous lines because that is how we do politics in Australia – but please, someone, for the love of Rhianna, just fire me into the sun already and get it over with. Scott Morrison finishes his press conference with an attack on the Greens, which in this political climate is an attack on Labor: Now, the Labor party have got to apply their own rule to their own decisions. If they want to have this rule, which says minor parties should be considered separate to the mainstream parties, well it seems that the Labor party doesn’t think the Greens have these extreme views. They’ve got to apply the same ruler to themselves. We’ve made our decisions on this. The challenge is on Labor now. Are you for national security? Are you for the US alliance? Are you for border protection? Are you against death taxes? If that’s your view, if you’re for all of those things, then by all means put the Greens ahead of the Liberal party. But if you’re not, then you shouldn’t do that. We now need to change the national anthem. We are no longer girt by sea, apparently, because – Labor. Scott Morrison: The only difference, when it comes to the National Energy Guarantee in terms of what Labor are proposing, is this: the reliability energy guarantee, which was part of the Neg we brought forward at the time, that’s now happening. That’s the important part. The bit Labor are applying to that is legislating a 45% emissions reduction target. That’s what Labor are doing. They are going to legislate that. That’s not going to reduce power prices. Labor’s Neg actually put prices not down, because they are going to legislate a reckless target that will hit wages, that will hit jobs, that will hit production. Let’s not forget what they’ve announced today is the extension, effectively, of the native veg laws in Queensland from Queensland Labor, which is basically going to land-lock the country and tell farmers and graziers and pastoralists around the country what they can do, or rather what they cannot do, on their own land. This is a massive tax on agricultural Australia. It’s a massive tax on jobs. It’s $35 billion that Australian companies are going to have to spend, sending money offshore to foreign carbon traders, carbon credits for Kazakhstan. This is what this is for. Say it with me now: a talking point does not make it true. Scott Morrison on Labor’s climate policy: Bill Shorten does not have a plan, he just has another tax. That’s all this is. Bill Shorten does not have a plan, he just has a tax. And then there is this absolute pearl of wisdom: “You make the point about electric vehicles. Well, the government is already taking a number of steps to support the growth in electric vehicles. “I mean, if you buy an electric vehicle, one of the things you don’t pay is fuel excise. That is already a major advantage for those buying electric vehicles, a big significant leg-up.” Could that be ... because they are electric? Actually no, I need to correct that. This election campaign is going to be a very long century. Scott Morrison: “That’s why we’ll be handing down a budget surplus tomorrow night, the first in 12 years. It’s been about keeping expenditure under control and it’s been about supporting the growth in the Australian economy and getting Australians off welfare and into work. It’s the classic 12-point turnaround. That works in AFL and NRL. You stop one team scoring down one end and you score on the other. “People receiving welfare under our government are now paying tax because they have jobs. That’s how you balance a budget. Scott Morrison just said “the PBS to me spells H.O.P.E”. This election campaign is going to be a very long decade. Andrew Leigh was asked about the government’s “carbon tax” (it’s not) criticism this morning while on Sky: It’s not, and if it were, then their own policy would be a carbon tax. Kieran, this is simply an extension of a scheme put in place by Malcolm Turnbull. Business has told us that they are sick of the climate wars. They’re sick of the bickering over climate and they want bipartisanship. Our view is the best way of achieving that is to extend the Turnbull government’s safeguard mechanism that applies to 0.01 % of companies, puts in place a pollution cap and is part of our commitment to seeing Australia meet our internationally agreed carbon targets. As you’ve said before, we’re also taking advice from business to improve the scheme by giving firms access to international credits. Angus Taylor is also running the “it’s a carbon tax” line while attacking Labor’s climate policy on Sky. Narrator: It’s not. There is about to be so much more of this. Labor will officially launch its climate policy at midday. There has been a bit of talk that Scott Morrison could head to Government House as soon as the budget is handed down and deny Bill Shorten his budget-in-reply speech (which is usually done on the Thursday). Back in November, when he announced the budget date, Morrison said this: We’ll deal with the normal budget week in the way budgets are always handled. So yes, I would anticipate that the leader of the opposition would make his reply in the normal way. Of course, Morrison is going to do whatever he believes is in the best interests of keeping the Coalition in power, so that could include a Wednesday trip down the road, but it is doubtful. Mostly because it would kickstart the election campaign with allegations of arrogance and bad sportsmanship, and I’m pretty sure those qualities don’t play so well in focus groups. On why Labor announced its climate policy today – budget eve, and usually one of the days when, as we say in the biz, the trash gets taken out (the budget tends to cut down on scrutiny because, well, there is usually plenty to scrutinise in the budget papers, even in a unicorn budget like this) – Mark Butler had this to say: This is about making sure, as we lead into the election, climate change is a particular focus of the campaign, and recognising that five or six years of vandalism on climate change policy cannot continue. It is simply an abrogation of the responsibility we have to our children, our grandchildren, and those beyond. The Greens are not impressed with Labor’s climate policy, with Adam Bandt calling it a “dog’s breakfast”. “There are a couple of good ideas here, but overall this is a dog’s breakfast of Liberal party leftovers, with no plan for coal and no hope of meeting the Paris agreement goals,” Brandt said in a statement. “Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. If you don’t have a plan for coal, you’re not serious about climate change.” You’ll find some of the Greens’ complaints below: Safeguards: “The Neg and so-called ‘safeguards’ were created by the climate change-denying Liberal party and should be put in the bin, not reheated by Labor and served up as a climate policy.” “By adopting the ineffective safeguard mechanism with huge carve-outs for some sectors, it looks like the free ride for big business in this country on climate will continue under Bill Shorten. International offsets: “Labor has also confirmed it will adopt a dodgy accounting trick that even Tony Abbott opposes by allowing business to use international offsets.” “International offsets delay climate action in Australia. More coal will be burnt at home and the transition to 100% renewables will be delayed.” Electric cars: “Not only does the target lack ambition, but the policy lacks mechanisms that would get us even close to 50% electric vehicles by 2030,” said Senator Janet Rice, Australian Greens transport and infrastructure spokesperson. “Labor’s EV announcement is nothing but an attempt to grab some headlines on climate change without any actual substance.” Doesn’t this just sound like an absolute par-tay! Deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Michael McCormack and minister for urban infrastructure Alan Tudge will discuss the Liberal and National government’s investment in infrastructure. That’ll be happening at 10.30am. I am just not sure we can handle that much charisma this early on a Monday morning. We also have Mathias Cormann once again uttering the words “carbon tax”, this time to ABC radio: Labor talks a lot, but what they have put out would harm the economy, would harm families, would cost jobs, would drive up unemployment and, indeed, Labor would bring back a carbon tax, they would force people across Australia to pay tens of billions of dollars in higher taxes, only for them to send that money overseas to pay for international carbon credits. ... You seem to be deliberately ignoring the fact that Labor have confirmed that they want to send money overseas to buy international carbon permits. That means that they will be imposing tens of billions of dollars in higher taxes on Australians, which should remain either in Australians’ pockets, so they can spend it here on Australia ... or should be available to government to invest on essential services here in Australia. If Labor wants to buy international carbon permits, as they have said they would, they will have to increase the tax burden on Australians ... and that clearly is going back to the carbon tax, the discredited carbon tax arrangements of past Labor governments. He, of course, was attacking Labor’s climate policy. But this time around we have the admission from Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff Peta Credlin, who in early 2017 told Sky News this about the last time the Coalition used the carbon tax attack line: Along comes a carbon tax. It wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know. It was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax. We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment. That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and when he cut through, Gillard was gone. Mark Butler, also speaking to Fran Kelly, responded just a few minutes after Cormann: What rubbish. Maybe he should go and talk to every single big business, including all of the businesses in his own state of Western Australia that cannot understand why a supposedly pro-market party has an objection to businesses trading in international carbon markets. We allow business to trade in every other robust international market – why on earth would we not allow them to trade in international carbon markets? Provided of course that they are robust and they are credible, which is Labor’s position – and it is also the position of the Australian business community. On why Labor won’t be using the Kyoto carbon credits as part of its own 45% emission reduction plan, Mark Butler told the ABC this morning: The first point to make is that we’re not going to meet the Kyoto commitment in 2020 – certainly not going to beat it. The bipartisan commitment was to reduce pollution by 14% by 2020. But because pollution has been rising under this government, the government’s own data released several weeks ago says we’ll only have cut pollution by 11%. So let’s dispel the myth that somehow we’re beating the Kyoto commitment. Ironically, what Scott Morrison is trying to do is take credit for the fact that in the early part of this decade, under Labor, we were overperforming on emissions cuts because of policies that Scott Morrison opposed tooth and nail. So we’re not going to have Australia join a club that only currently has Ukraine as a member. We’re taking a position consistent with UK, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden and other countries, to which we usually compare ourselves. As I said, we need real cuts in emissions – not dodgy accounting tricks. I’m not sure that Josh Frydenberg has approved this. Or that, you know, this is how governments work. The Bendigo Advertiser reports the Liberal Bendigo candidate, Sam Gayed, plans on beating Labor with the “anything you can do, I can do 10% better” strategy. From the report: [Sam] Gayed planned on asking the Liberals to match and add 10% more funds to any pledge for community projects or initiatives within the Bendigo electorate. “I believe the Liberals are best at managing the economy, producing a budget surplus. That’s why we can spend more on schools, hospitals and community projects,” he said. The Labor member for Bendigo, Lisa Chesters, said the idea sounded like a “catchy marketing campaign”, rather than listening to the people of Bendigo. “Is this federal politics or is this Bunnings Warehouse?” she asked. We are just being visited by a group of 12 students from Rotary who are here at Parliament House – and awkwardly watching me type this. Always great to welcome visitors – particularly future leaders. Is anyone even pretending we haven’t been in an election campaign since December any more? Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt will make a health announcement at 9.45. Back to domestic politics and for Labor, at least today, it is all about climate policy. As Katharine Murphy reports: Labor will set a national electric vehicles target of 50% new car sales by 2030, and 50% for the government fleet by 2025, as well as allowing business to deduct a 20% depreciation for private fleet EVs valued at more than $20,000, as part of its climate change policy to be unveiled on Monday. Bill Shorten will also flag a new pollution regulation on car retailers “in line with” 105g CO2/km for light vehicles, which is consistent with American emissions standards, but will consult on coverage and the timeline to phase in the change rather than impose it immediately. That caveat notwithstanding, the signal is likely to trigger pushback. Efforts to impose pollution standards for vehicles have been derailed during the Coalition’s period in office, in part by internal opposition from Nationals, and by strenuous lobbying from influential stakeholders including motoring associations, driver groups and the Australian Institute of Petroleum. As Guardian Australia revealed on Saturday, Labor will, if it wins the coming election, beef up the Morrison government’s heavily criticised safeguard mechanism. It will use the existing architecture, but create new pollution reduction requirements for the aviation sector, cement, steel and aluminium, mining and gas, direct combustion and the non-electricity energy sectors. You can read the whole report here Things may be absolutely shizen at the moment. But at least we’ll always have Kylie. Even Ireland wants to claim her. Or at least their prime minister does. From the Irish Times: Taoiseach Leo Varadkar asked pop star Kylie Minogue if he could welcome her to Ireland personally when she came to Dublin for a concert last year. Mr Varadkar wrote a note to the Australian singer and actress on official headed notepaper from the Office of the Taoiseach, which was released following a freedom of information request. The letter, which was signed “Leo V Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister)” was sent before Ms Minogue’s planned concert at Dublin’s 3Arena on October 7th, which she had to reschedule due to a throat infection. “Dear Kylie,” the Taoiseach wrote. “Just wanted to drop you a short note in advance of the concert in Dublin. I am really looking forward to it. Am a huge fan! I understand you are staying in the Merrion Hotel which is just across the street from my office in Government Buildings. If you like, I’d love to welcome you to Ireland personally.” Mathias Cormann was sent out this morning to talk budget: The budget tomorrow will show that the Coalition has been successful for the last 5.5 years in making the economy stronger, creating more jobs, driving the unemployment rate down and, indeed, putting the budget on a stronger and improving trajectory [for] the future … all essential things that Australians rely on funding can be guaranteed in the budget,” he told ABC radio this morning. People will remember when Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen were last in government they left behind a weakening economy, rising unemployment and rapidly deteriorating budget situation. We have been able to turn this around. This is not the time to take risks with high-taxing, central command agenda. It would make the economy weaker and all Australians poorer. That line – that Labor left the budget in a terrible condition last time it was in power – has been popping up from government MPs quite frequently lately. They all just seem to miss out the part about the GFC having occurred at the same time and the whole developed world saw their budgets tank at the same time. Speaking of April Fools’ and electioneering – Ed Husic has a new Facebook profile pic Happy April Fools’ Day. More importantly, happy budget 2019 eve. There is no budget tree in Canberra this year, because, well, it’s not the second Tuesday in May. But winter has arrived in the capital. So have the politicians. I am not saying our honourable representatives are the reason for the sudden chill, but I am not not saying that either. Given how batshit crazy the last few weeks have been, and given how much we have to get through this week – censures, new senators, the last of the unofficial election campaigning, the budget, the budget reply, the upcoming trip to the governor general to launch the insanity officially – we have decided to run the blog a day early. Parliament doesn’t officially sit until tomorrow. But Labor has announced its climate policy, just as the government is revving up its budget surplus preview, so there is plenty for us to chew over for the next few hours. Mike Bowers is on deck, as is Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian brains trust. You also have 100% of my presence and the last 27% of my brain, so it should be a good brain. While I hunt down a coffee to try to round my brain power up to 30%, remember you can find us in the comments, or social media – and I’m interested to know – when do you think Scott Morrison will head to Yarralumla? What day? What will be in the budget? Ready? Let’s get into it.",Australia news
"James O’Brien: ‘I can live with ‘centrist dad’. Liberal? Yeah. Do-gooder? I try’ I meet James O’Brien in the LBC offices, straight after his three-hour show on a Thursday morning. It is the day after the UK parliament has voted on its series of Brexit alternatives and said “no” to all of them, and I have a feeling he will have a thing or two to say. Since 2010, really, O’Brien’s has been a voice of reason in an ever-madder pool. While his colleagues at LBC were wondering why we can’t just leave Europe already, and what do young people need houses for anyway, and his erstwhile colleagues at Newsnight were fawning over the far right, O’Brien reminded us who we used to be: passionate yet reasonable, caustic yet kind, apparently genuinely committed to equality and all the Scandi values of tolerance, generosity and respect that went with it. Yet, because the clips of O’Brien that go viral are always the most explosive or playful ones – most recently, it was his skewering of Dominic Raab – his gravity sneaks up on you. Right now, he is deadly serious. He will not predict what happens with Brexit, he says, not in that jocular media abnegation of responsibility, but because: “You can’t make valid predictions in an environment of such utter madness and hypocrisy. Right up until Christmas, it was almost all predictable. When red lines collided with the Good Friday agreement, the result could only be chaos and denial. But then, when it moves away from the realm of things that you can understand by reading and listening, it becomes impossible to call.” He is a bit like Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Tory MP, not in his politics or at all in his manner, but in his palpable outrage at what we have been brought to. “It still surprises me, even today, we’ve got sitting MPs talking about WTO terms as if that was even a thing, as opposed to an international safety net, designed to rescue countries that have been turned into basket cases by circumstances beyond their control from complete economic collapse. It’s not something you would ever choose.” He divides Brexiters into four discrete categories, because “it’s impossible to cultivate a theory that applies to them all”. In the Nadine Dorries set are the ones who “just don’t get it. There’s a sort of Dunning-Kruger effect going on where they really aren’t bright enough to understand.” (Dorries famously asked her ERG-ish WhatsApp group to explain what a customs union was, after she got hammered about it repeatedly on Twitter.) “It’s a miracle they’ve ended up in the House of Commons.” (O’Brien retains quite an old-school respect for the institutions of democracy.) The Mark Francoises of this world, meanwhile, are fogged by an “English exceptionalism – this sense that Europe would somehow buckle, and do the opposite of all the things they’ve said they’re going to do, because we’re English. That might mean because we’re economically strong, or it might mean because we’re culturally enriched, but essentially, it’s a Commando comic, second world war revivalism.” Then there are MPs who just made the wrong call: who thought that the pressure from British and European manufacturers who wanted to continue selling things to one another would assure a reasonable and mutually profitable outcome. “Because they didn’t understand the indivisibility of the four freedoms [movement, capital, goods, services], and didn’t fully grasp the relationship between membership and access. I’m very forgiving of MPs who may have gone down that road – but, of course, less forgiving when they don’t put their hands up and admit that they made a terrible mistake and have misled voters.” Finally, there are the Bill Cashes. “The honourable Brexiter, who is profoundly wrong, but for sympathetic reasons. [Cash] hardly knew his dad, because he died in the last years of the second world war [after the D-day landings in Normandy], and someone like that has grown up with an impression of Germany that is now dated. But you’re not going to hear any castigation from me of someone who still blames the Germans for growing up without his dad.” The funny thing is, LBC never hired O’Brien to be a leftie firebrand: when he joined the station in 2003, it was still owned by Chrysalis, a former media group much more interested in music than in anything else, and was trying to keep away from current affairs. He was the former showbiz editor of the Daily Express, a nice, easy-going lad from a nice family, maybe a bit of a mockney – but at the end of the last century, everyone was (he went to Ampleforth College, the Catholic boarding school, but emphatically doesn’t sound RP). “I was really political when I was a kid,” he says (born in 1972, he is now 47 – so the years when he came of political age would have been the grindingly awful last gasp of the Tory government in the early 1990s, when they were clean out of even bad ideas). “That period of Blairism – well, I was still selling suits in 97 [in the Aquascutum store on Regent Street in central London], but getting shifts on gossip columns. Before the Gulf war, there was just so much consensus in politics. There didn’t seem to be any hills worth dying on.” Rosie Boycott, his editor when he was at the Express, reacts with bafflement to his current incarnation, not remembering him as interested in politics at all. “The line I always use,” O’Brien comments, “is what would you rather have done: hang out with Norman Lamont or hang out with Norman Cook?” Essentially, he was radicalised by the coalition government. “It’s probably only since 2010 that I’ve felt fear about what politicians were either preparing to do or were accidentally doing. Austerity was a big thing for me.” The cliche of talk radio is that it leans heavily towards the right, the US shock jock style exported here, often resulting in a stream of unmediated sub Ayn Randian bilge that you would never get on TV. But actually, if you introduce someone who is genuinely listening to the phone-in format, it can tell a story about the state of the nation that not many people are telling. “The call I always remember,” O’Brien says, “was two police officers, husband and wife, and to them it was quite matter-of-fact, although they wouldn’t have told me the story if they hadn’t felt that it was significant. Their childcare costs, coupled with their shift patterns, coupled with their pay freeze, meant that they were now meeting in a cul-de-sac between shifts, and as they crossed, handing their baby from one car to the other. I don’t know where I got this slightly sentimental attitude to the public sector. I went to public school. My late grandad was a copper, but not when I knew him; I certainly didn’t grow up with a proper appreciation of their importance. But something about that really stuck in my craw.” It is hard to say whether or not this is just because he is talking to a journalist, but his ire tends much more naturally towards print media than it does to any named politician (although we swoop back, periodically, to Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson just to touch base with how bad things have become, as so many conversations do). “There was a round of industrial action by firefighters, and that was a big wake-up moment for me. The Fleet Street line was: ‘They all commute from Ibiza’, ‘They’ve all got eight jobs’, and I couldn’t quite believe that people I’d known when I was on newspapers, people I’d liked and sat on panels with, were writing columns about how the firefighters didn’t deserve our trust and support. I remember thinking: ‘Crikey, this is a really ugly business that I’m in.’ Journalists, particularly on Murdoch titles, were queuing up to tell the public not to trust and support firefighters, then teachers, then junior doctors. And that, of course, leads inexorably to Brexit.” I am sceptical – the red tops have always been foaming at the mouth about something. He rattles off a quick and polished list of Islamophobic articles and I concede that it is worse, now, than it has been in my lifetime. But I still think something far stranger has happened to broadcast media, which has mistaken its neutrality duty for a blanket ban on any kind of judgment or moral compass. O’Brien’s greatest regret, where Brexit is concerned, is that he was filling in on Newsnight at the time of the EU referendum, “and their impartiality requirements leached into my other world”. He gave Newsnight up for that reason. “I loved doing both. People sometimes kindly suggest that it was an act of epic principle when I walked away, so I could carry on saying what I wanted to say about Trump and Brexit. But if I’d been paying my mortgage with my Newsnight money, and doing LBC for shits and giggles, it would have been a different tension, a different dynamic.” He was one of the speakers at the people’s vote march last month, and introduced Sadiq Khan, who he knows quite well from his LBC programme, but isn’t touting as a future Labour leader. “Sadiq says he has no ambitions beyond City Hall, and I’m comfortable with that. For my taste, he’s too lawyerly.” He then launches into a surprising paean to the courage of Tom Watson, though it’s only surprising on Thursday – by last Friday, everyone was talking about Tom Watson in the context of some fantasy government of national unity, which suggests manoeuvres are going on somewhere, and O’Brien knows people who know stuff. He’s no friend of the opposition, however, and is considered the ultimate centrist dad, as much of a hate figure for Corbyn loyalists as he is for fans of Rees-Mogg. “I can live with ‘centrist dad’. So many words that shouldn’t be insults have become insults. Liberal? Yeah. Do-gooder? I try. Virtue signaller? What do you want people to do; try to do the right thing in secret?” I am not sure that he is a classic centrist: he doesn’t have that surrendered, late-Blairite fatalism, that sense that capitalism is as capitalism does, and the nice people will try to make it better for the poor people. And I am not sure he is a classic radio polemicist either: even though he is fabled for his trenchant opinions, he remains genuinely interested in his callers – they are never just meat for his narrative. He is an instinctive egalitarian – you can hear it in the respect he has for his callers, not in a focus group/vox pop/specimen way, but as equals, who he is actually listening to and prepared to engage with. It’s quite unusual in public life. “I was getting bored with ‘What do you think? Thanks, John; now we’ll go to Brenda’, never asking them to justify their position,” he says. His Damascene moment was with a caller called John, who thought you couldn’t say anything these days without being called a racist. “I said: ‘Say whatever you want, mate. I promise I won’t call you a racist.’ And he said: ‘All right, I live in Hounslow; it’s full of Pakistanis and they all smell.’ There was a long pause as I pondered this astonishing contribution to the programme. I was searching for the question that would pick it all to pieces like pulling on a thread, and the whole jumper falls apart. ‘What do they smell of, John?’ ‘Curry.’ ‘Do you like curry, John?’ And he said: ‘Yes.’ And that’s why I still love my job.” It’s a story he tells a lot - it’s in his book, How to be Right … In a World Gone Wrong. And he likes it, I think, because it gets to the heart of his work: part of listening to people with respect is challenging them, without hostility, as you would a friend. “Everything changed for me when I started asking people ‘Why?’ rather than ‘What?’,” he says.",Politics
"Labor's climate change policy explained: here's what we know Just days before the federal election is called, Labor has released the final component of its climate change policy. Scott Morrison has promptly declared it is carbon tax 2.0 and the regulations will impose massive costs on Australians. Given this partisan debate, which has paralysed Australian politics for a decade, has been characterised by hyperbole and misinformation, let’s work through this latest policy instalment, sector by sector, and then consider the implications. Energy Labor says if it wins the coming election it will try to implement the national energy guarantee abandoned by the Coalition, with a higher emissions reduction target – 45% by 2030. The government’s electricity target was 26%. If the Coalition in opposition declines to support the Neg, Labor will pursue plan B. Plan B involves topping up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the tune of $10bn and a new $5bn fund to modernise ageing transmission infrastructure. The objective of the intervention is to drive higher take-up of renewables in the grid. Labor has a target of sourcing 50% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Coupled with this, a Just Transition Authority will be established to help manage the retirement of the coal fleet, with generators required to give three years’ notice of closure. Heavy industry As well as reviving the national energy guarantee, Labor is borrowing another existing Coalition policy to bring down industrial pollution. It will use the current safeguard mechanism, which is part of the Direct Action scheme, but will extend coverage so that more companies are captured. The scheme works like this: companies are allocated baselines, and if they pollute above that level, they need to buy carbon credits (more about this is in minute), which imposes a cost on their business. Labor says it will reduce pollution in the covered entities by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030, but is planning to consult with firms on what their baseline should be, and about the specific emissions reduction trajectory for each entity. It is also planning to assist emissions-intensive trade-exposed companies with the transition. Transport The approach in transport is two pronged. Labor is proposing to introduce vehicle emissions standards “in line with” 105 grams of CO2 pollution per kilometre, which is the same as the US. The standard is imposed on car retailers (not manufacturers), which means car dealers will have to offset sales of high-emissions vehicles with sales of low-emissions vehicles. Coupled with this, Labor is setting targets for the take up of electric vehicles. It wants a national EV target of 50% of new sales by 2030, and a government fleet target of 50% of new sales by 2025, and it will also allow businesses to claim deductions if they buy EVs valued at more than $20,000. It will also require all federally funded road upgrades to incorporate EV charging infrastructure. Carbon credits Given Labor will impose significantly tougher pollution rules than the Coalition, it also wants to boost the supply of carbon offsets. With this market becoming more important, Labor is flagging a new certification framework to ensure that carbon credits are sufficiently high quality. It will also strengthen the Carbon Farming Initiative, which allows farmers and landholders to generate carbon credits which they can sell on the carbon market. It will also allow heavy emitters to use international permits to meet their pollution reduction requirements, but Labor is not yet saying what limits might apply. It will not use carryover credits from the Kyoto period, which the Morrison government intends to use to help meet the Paris target. Agriculture Farmers are largely off the hook in Labor’s policy. On the positive side of the ledger there are opportunities to generate carbon credits, which generates income. The sting is land clearing. Labor is signalling it wants to extend the Queensland regime to other jurisdictions, working through the Council of Australian Governments process. That’s a principle though. There’s no detail beyond that in the policy. Will the policy cut pollution by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030? This is the big question. Unsurprisingly, given the toxic history, the Morrison government has resumed hollering about carbon taxes and environmental regulations that will bring Australia to its knees, but the fact is we don’t have a number of important details that would allow anyone to make fact-based conclusions. Labor says we’ll have a new vehicle emissions standard, but hasn’t said when that will apply, or the specific level of emissions reduction from transport it is factoring in as a consequence. Similarly Labor is arguing it will achieve a 45% cut from heavy emitters while allowing caveats like consultations on baselines and trajectories. Labor is not planning to release a carbon budget, which would make transparent estimates about the level of pollution cuts it is factoring-in in each sector. It is unable to say how carbon trading between the energy and industrial sectors might work because the proposed regulatory frameworks are conceptual rather than fully fleshed out. Given there are stakeholders sitting on the sidelines ready to go to war, and the Coalition is hoping that calling something that isn’t a carbon tax a carbon tax (again) represents a sound political strategy with an election in sight – the vagueness from Labor is deliberate. But there are significant unanswered questions here. Will this policy happen, even if Labor wins? Another big question. The Coalition is not showing any sign of having a substantial conversion on climate change. Labor will likely need the Greens to get various changes legislated and the Greens will want a higher level of ambition than is evident in this policy. The Greens will want Labor to execute a faster transition away from coal, and they are already saying no to the use of international permits. So it’s entirely possible that the long unproductive deadlock will continue. We have a long way to go.",Australia news
"Singapore to introduce anti-fake news law, allowing removal of articles Singapore is set to introduce a new anti-fake news law, allowing authorities in the city-state to remove articles deemed to breach government regulations. The law, being read in parliament today, will stoke fears that Singapore’s authoritarian government will further stifle dissent in an already tightly-controlled media environment. Facebook, Twitter and Google have Asia headquarters in Singapore, with the companies expected to be under increased pressure to aid the law’s implementation. On Friday Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong suggested that the law would tackle the country’s growing problem of online misinformation. It follows an examination of fake news in Singapore by a parliamentary committee last year, which concluded that the city-state was a “target of hostile information campaigns”. Lee said the law will require media outlets to correct fake news articles, and “show corrections or display warnings about online falsehoods so that readers or viewers can see all sides and make up their own minds about the matter.” “In extreme and urgent cases, the legislation will also require online news sources to take down fake news before irreparable damage is done,” he said. Last week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called for more regulation of social media by governments. However, last year Facebook representatives told the Singapore committee that the company opposed fake news legislation in the city-state. Kirsten Han, a Singaporean activist and journalist also consulted by the committee, expressed concern that broad terms such as “fake news” were open to abuse by authoritarian governments. Reporters Without Borders ranked Singapore 151st out of 180 in its 2018 Press Freedom Index: three places below Russia. Reporters Without Borders said Singaporean media censorship was rife, and that “red lines imposed by the authorities … apply to an ever-wider range of issues and public figures. As in many southeast Asian countries, governmental plans to legislate against ‘fake news’ are seen as a threat to the freedom to inform.” In January Vietnam introduced cybersecurity laws that essentially criminalised the criticism of the country’s government on the internet. In the Philippines Maria Ressa, founder of news website Rappler, was arrested on Friday on what supporters said were politically-motivated charges. In April last year Malaysia passed its Anti-Fake News 2018 bill, introducing jail terms of up to six years for those breaching it. The country’s current leadership has attempted to repeal the bill following the arrest for corruption of Najib Razak, who was prime minister when it was introduced.",World news
"Are PhDs just cheap labour for universities? When Karin Bodewits started her PhD in molecular biology at the University of Edinburgh, she felt “excited and privileged, brimming with hope”. Over the following four years, her enthusiasm waned. “That seems like another person in another life,” she recalls. “I saw a world where unreachable glory was the goal and desperation the order of the day.” Bodewits wrote a book about her disillusionment, shedding light on a university system failing to have open conversations about the power plays between supervisors and students, the lack of mental health support, and the absence of careers advice for PhD candidates. “I wasn’t prepared well for life after my PhD,” she says. “My supervisor wouldn’t have accepted me spending time on something different than research.” Bodewits now gives careers advice seminars to PhD students, and is disappointed to see her experience replicated. “The incentives behind PhD programmes are wrong,” she says. “At the moment it seems we’re training people because it’s cheap labour. If that’s the incentive, then for purely research-based PhDs we’re training too many for the current labour market.” This is a common complaint from PhD students frustrated with an academic careers pipeline that requires a succession of highly competitive short-term contracts in cities all over the world. Only a small number eventually obtain a coveted permanent role; research from 2010 suggests just 3.5% of science PhDs secure permanent academic positions. There’s evidence to suggest the pressure takes a toll on the mental health of PhD students, who report a higher rate of problems than the general population. Yet the universities minister, Chris Skidmore, recently asked universities to “think about how we can get more people staying on for PhDs in the future”. An increase in the research talent base will be vital for the government to deliver on its promised increase in investment in research and development to 2.4% by 2027, he said. So why does the feeling that there aren’t enough jobs for PhD graduates persist? According to Clare Viney, chief executive of Vitae, which supports the career development of researchers, we will need to double the number of researchers to reach the government’s target. But not all of those jobs will be within universities – they might be in the R&amp;D department of a private company. “One of the challenges is that the vast majority of PhDs want to stay in academia,” says Viney. “This is where the tension comes from. Eighty per cent of researchers want to become academics but the reality is it’s a lot less [who do so]. In some disciplines it could be as low as a few per cent.” Viney thinks universities need to have “honest conversations” about managing the expectations of PhD students. They can also better help them understand the skills they’re developing go beyond subject knowledge, such as entrepreneurship, teamwork, innovative thinking and communication. “It’s about self-awareness and emotional intelligence, focusing on researcher as much as their research,” she says. Although people development has been a common feature of the corporate world for some time, Viney says it is comparatively new within universities. They are waking up to the fact that they’re not just responsible for “kit and keeping the lights on and making sure they have world-class facilities, but also that they’re developing people to be the best they can be”. As a result, looking after early-career researchers is a new brief within the leadership teams at some universities. Among these is David Bogle, who is responsible for 6,000 doctoral students and 3,500 postdoctoral students at UCL. He agrees that PhD candidates can be too absorbed in the detail of their research, especially in the humanities and social sciences. “Really careful analysis of evidence for a history PhD is hugely valuable for lots of public policy work, in the media and in the law,” he says. “But they tend to still be fixated on medieval papyrology rather than seeing the broader skills.” Bogle has looked at mental health among doctoral candidates, and developed an action plan aimed at reducing isolation and increasing support networks. “There is an issue, and I’m still not clear in my own mind what it is,” he says. “Is it because a certain type of person wants to do a PhD? Or is it because we put undue pressure on them?” Broadly speaking, Bogle thinks a lot of work has gone into improving support, skills development and careers advice for PhD candidates in the past 10-15 years. Yet he acknowledges there is still a “communication issue with employers”, who universities have failed to convince of the value of a PhD. “I’ve been trying to tell that story. We’ve all got to get out and do it,” he says. “These are very smart, very skilled people who are able to drive innovation in the economy. “There’s a whole raft of smaller companies that want innovation but struggle with it. I think they’re a bit scared of how to handle these people who might challenge what they do.” Bogle thinks the real problem is at postdoc level – the short-term research contracts that are the next step after a PhD. Although they are classed as staff (PhD candidates are students), there are far more of them in universities than there are permanent academic jobs, meaning that securing a postdoc is no guarantee of an academic career. “The mindset is wrong. It’s not enough about the people we’re developing, and it’s too much about producing papers, patents and data,” he says. Research funders are taking action. The Wellcome Trust has recently overhauled the conditions attached to the way it funds postdocs and PhDs. According to Anne-Marie Coriat, head of UK and EU research landscape, the funder will now place “dual attention on the quality of science and the culture which sits around the way training is delivered”, including diversity, proper supervision, looking after mental health, and support for researchers to transition to the next step in their career. This includes a transition fund that can be used for any work that relates to the next step, such as writing a policy paper or undertaking a placement in a school. “We think this will open up the optimism with which people should be facing careers in research,” Coriat says. “These skills are required in all sorts of different settings, but what we don’t know is where those careers will be headed in 5-10 years’ time, because tech and data are really driving the pace.” Coriat adds that quality advice on where science and research careers can lead is missing. As technology and automation transform the jobs market, she thinks gathering a “live feed” of data on how career paths are changing will be important. Frustration with the academic career path has existed for decades, but Coriat sees the current moment as the ideal opportunity to transform research culture for the better. Meanwhile, the government’s commitment to increase research spend “links beautifully” with lots of other projects. She cautions that meaningful change “will take time to deliver”, but adds: “There’s a lot of willingness to tackle this.”",Education
"Nina X by Ewan Morrison review – life after Comrade Chen Ewan Morrison has written about cults before. His last novel, 2012’s Close Your Eyes, told the story of Rowan, a woman whose identity was forged in a 70s commune, and who seemed unable to fashion a self free from the overpowering collectivism of her upbringing. That novel played intelligently with pronouns, moving between the we of the collective and the you that Rowan employs (instead of the elusive I) when recounting her tale. Close Your Eyes felt like a break from Morrison’s previous work, which began with three books exploring the darker reaches of human behaviour – Swung, Distance and Ménage – and moved on to a formally interesting but ultimately flawed examination of capitalism in the fragmented Tales from the Mall. Close Your Eyes gave the impression of a writer in between identities, still wedded to the experimentation of his early books, while moving towards a more populist, accessible mode. That novel rather sank without trace. I can say with some certainty that Nina X won’t. This is a book that explores many of the same themes as its predecessor – the boundaries of the self, the clash between extremes of historical attempts at collectivism and the hyper-individualism of contemporary society, the legacy of the (false) idealism of the 60s and 70s. It does all of these, though, in a manner more convincing, moving and successful. It’s also extremely funny. The novel takes the form of a series of journals kept by Nina X, some of which are set in 2018 and early 2019, when Nina is 28, while others have been retrieved from the days when she was known only as “the Project”, a child brought up in the paranoid and claustrophobic Maoist cult of Comrade Chen: “I was like this test to prove that a child kept free from the inherited prejudices of history would grow up to be an improved kind of human.” Nina’s early journals are carefully annotated by the other members of the cult, which was once much larger, but has been reduced to Chen and the four women who remain in his thrall: Comrades Uma, Ruth, Jeni and Zana. The self, Chen tells his acolytes, is a construct of the capitalist machine; his followers are prohibited from speaking about themselves in the first person. One of the covert narrative threads in the book is Nina’s journey from referring to herself in the third person to a more straightforward first-person perspective. Morrison represents this struggle with self-censorship through a series of erasures – words printed in barely legible grey type. It’s an effective conceit and, twinned with the interweaving of journals from the past and the present, lends the plot a pleasing complexity. Cults have long fascinated novelists, providing as they do a crucible in which the pressures that animate a narrative are magnified. Nina X refers regularly, if obliquely, to its antecedents, particularly Jonathan Franzen’s Purity and TC Boyle’s Drop City. One also can’t help think of two other clear influences – Wolfgang Becker’s film Good Bye Lenin! and the Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, whose plot Nina X follows with occasionally uncomfortable proximity. It’s Nina’s voice, though, that really sets this book apart, as Morrison seeks to represent linguistically the deep traumas of Nina’s upbringing. She has the intellectual capacity of an adult, but the emotional experience and understanding of a child. Doctors see in her a “lack of affect and inability to empathise”, but her worldview recalls Martian poetry, bringing new perspectives to familiar objects and societal norms. Nina is (mis)treated by the operatives of the welfare state, harassed by the press, processed by the bureaucrats of a system that purports to privilege the individual but actually renders and categorises those unwilling to conform to its rules. In all of this, Morrison asks us to examine what is meant by freedom, and how not all forms of control are as visible and obviously malicious as those of Comrade Chen. • Nina X by Ewan Morrison is published by Fleet (£14.99).

"My daughter is buying me out of a house – must she pay stamp duty? Q My two daughters and I are the joint owners of a property for which we paid cash (so there is no mortgage involved). One of my daughters lives in the house and is now in the process – with her husband – of taking out a £120,000 mortgage so that she can buy her sister and me out (the house is valued at £180,000). On the strength of the £60,000 that she will get from her sister for her share of the house, my other daughter is also thinking of taking out a mortgage to buy her first home. Although neither of my daughters has had a mortgage before – and so in my view are first-time buyers – we have been told that they will both need to pay stamp duty on their mortgages. Is this correct? JC A No, it is not correct that your daughters will have to pay stamp duty land tax (SDLT) on their mortgages because SDLT is not charged on mortgages but on what is called “consideration given” for a property which usually means what was paid for a property (or a share of a property). It is also incorrect to think that your daughters should be eligible for first-time-buyer relief from SDLT – which lets first-time buyers off SDLT on the first £300,000 of properties costing up to £500,000 – because, strictly speaking, they are not first-time buyers because they have previously owned property. In the words of HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC): “In order to count as a first-time buyer, a purchaser must not, either alone or with others, have previously acquired a major interest in a dwelling situated anywhere in the world.” The good news for the daughter who is buying you and her sister out of the property she is living in is that because the amount she is paying you both is less than the SDLT nil-rate limit of £125,000, she won’t face an SDLT bill. Her sister, however, will have to pay SDLT if she ends up buying a property which costs more than £125,000.",Money
"Travelodge failed to warn me about Network Rail noise I recently stayed at a Travelodge hotel in Macclesfield adjacent to the station. I was woken at midnight by loud drilling due to maintenance by Network Rail. This continued until approximately 3am and I was unable to sleep. Network Rail advised me that Travelodge was informed of this maintenance in February, and a week before my booking. It also told me Travelodge and all hotels must inform customers when work is taking place. Travelodge refused to acknowledge this and claimed Network Rail did not inform it. Please help me to get it to respond. VE, Chorlton, Manchester A station hotel sounds like the perfect solution if you have an early train; not so good if there’s disruptive overnight engineering work. We checked with Network Rail, which confirmed its standard policy is to do a letter drop to residential addresses, hotels and other buildings potentially affected by works – with schedules typically drawn up many months ahead. Travelodge agreed this was the case and that it usually received “excellent communication” from Network Rail on these occasions. However, the Macclesfield hotel manager said, it did not do so this time.

"Julián Castro: mayor, housing secretary and America's first Latino president? Last June, at the height of America’s family separation crisis when thousands of migrant children were being wrenched from their parents’ arms and held in cages, Julián Castro drove through the blazing heat of the Rio Grande Valley to the Ursula detention center on the US-Mexico border. He stood outside the locked entrance to a building where separations were taking place, and was overcome by revulsion. It was as if, he writes in his memoir An Unlikely Journey, “an American ideal had been desecrated. This was a wake-up call for the nation”. The moment was all the more visceral for Castro because 96 years previously, some 250 miles farther north along the border, his grandmother Victoria had left behind the land of her birth and entered the US through the Eagle Pass crossing. Mamo, as Castro called her, was only seven at the time and had been orphaned a few days earlier, but she found a welcome reception and was eased into a new life in America. The contrast between the cruelty of the treatment of the children in 2018 and Mamo’s experience in 1922 got Castro thinking. “How different my life would have been,” he writes, “if circumstances for immigrants almost a century ago had been more like they are now.” His grandmother’s narrative has been deployed by Castro at key points in his emergence as a politician. The theme of the opportunity she gave him by coming to the US as a child ran through his speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2012 that propelled him on to the national political stage. Now it is being put to use again as he frames his personal manifesto as one of the earliest candidates and the only Latino to declare a 2020 run for the White House. The narrative is all the more sharply drawn in the age of Trump. When the Guardian interviewed Castro in Austin, Texas, last month he recalled his reaction to Trump’s incendiary remarks about Mexican criminals and rapists at the launch of his own presidential campaign in June 2015. “It both pissed me off and saddened me,” Castro said. “I knew how wrong he was because I knew my own grandmother and how much she contributed to this country.” He might have added that one of Mamo’s most notable contributions to America was Castro himself, a soft-spoken, highly educated graduate of Stanford and Harvard law school who went on to become mayor of San Antonio, Texas, and later the housing secretary in the Obama administration. Castro’s presidential candidacy is in itself an implicit rebuke to the current White House incumbent: with his dapper suits and immaculate grooming, Castro is as far from the nightmarish caricature of the immigrant rapist that Trump has invoked as any third generation Mexican American could be. Now Castro, 44, is trying to turn that contrast into presidential capital. But in the already exceptionally crowded field of Democratic hopefuls, he is struggling to be heard. While Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was awarded an individual CNN town hall, and has seen his standing in the polls duly rise, Castro, the former mayor of a city with 15 times the population, not to mention his federal government service, had to settle with a modest CNN interview. Less than three months into his campaign, he is already facing probing questions: can his message be distinctive enough to stand out? Can he mobilise Latino voters to turn up for the primaries in large enough numbers to make an impact? Does he have a shot at fulfilling Mamo’s narrative as the first Latino president of the United States? From San Antonio to Washington Julián Castro was born and raised in the West Side of San Antonio, a Hispanic area populated by poor, working-class Mexican American families. Apart from Mamo, two individuals dominated Castro’s childhood and helped steer his political career. His mother, Rosie Castro, not only raised a family as a single parent (his father Jesse Guzmán left when Julián was eight years old) but was also an impassioned advocate of Hispanic civil rights. As a proud Chicana and activist with La Raza Unida, a Mexican American political party founded in Texas in 1970, Rosie Castro helped overcome electoral barriers to Latino representation in San Antonio and narrowly failed to win election to the city council. Castro describes her as a “hell-raising civil rights fighter”, recalling how she exposed him to campaigning from the age of four. Rosie also instilled in him the conviction that education and hard work were the way to overcome disadvantage and fulfill one’s potential. That message was equally drilled by her into the second towering influence in Julián’s life: his identical twin brother Joaquin. Julián is the older of the pair and remarkably – given that they were born just one minute apart – his seniority is still evident today. Julián is the natural executive of the two, the decision-maker; Joaquin is a little more extroverted and outspoken, the deliberator. Despite such fine nuances between them, the duo are inseparable. Following their mother’s edict, they worked hard and secured places together to Stanford, and then Harvard. The first significant time they spent apart was when Julián interned in the White House one summer while Joaquin joined a law firm back in Texas. Once they were done with higher education they both embarked on careers in politics and to this day they continue to follow parallel tracks: Julián, a city councilor, mayor, federal housing secretary, presidential candidate; Joaquin, a member of the Texas house of representatives, US congressman, now contemplating a US Senate race against Republican John Cornyn. Along the way, they have consistently had each other’s backs. It is no coincidence that Joaquin is Julián’s presidential campaign chairman. “If you are in the orbit of the Castro twins you quickly come to realize that they are each other’s own best adviser – it doesn’t matter who else is around them, they will always listen to each other first,” said Jaime Castillo, a close aide to Julián Castro in both his roles as mayor and housing secretary. The other characteristic that stood out for Castillo was that Castro never forgot the tribulations of life on San Antonio’s West Side. “He might wear tailored suits, but he was always firmly rooted and committed to policies that he thought would advance the kind of neighborhoods like the one where he grew up,” Castillo said. As mayor, Castro set out to do something about San Antonio’s record as the most unequal city in America. He created Café College, a free advice service for low-income students that helps them apply for college. On a bigger scale, he followed his mother’s belief that education was the route to opportunity by creating an ambitious early learning scheme called Pre-K 4 SA, managing to persuade taxpayers to fund it through an increase in sales tax of an eighth of a cent per dollar. The program now provides more than 2,000 four-year-olds with high quality all-day schooling. Castro’s leadership in San Antonio brought him to the attention of Obama and an invitation to be the first Latino to deliver a keynote speech at the DNC. In turn, that led in 2014 to him being offered the post of secretary of the federal department of housing and urban development (Hud), a job he held for the final two years of Obama’s presidency. The Castro brand of eye-catching initiatives designed to widen opportunity for less advantaged communities can be seen again stamped on his brief spell at Hud. He founded ConnectHome, a partnership with internet providers to bring the digital web to people in public housing. He also introduced new rules requiring housing authorities to combat segregation – an initiative that Ben Carson, who replaced Castro at Hud once Trump entered office, promptly scrapped. Lourdes Castro Ramirez, who led the office of public housing under him, said that Castro viewed Hud as the department of opportunity. “His motivation was simple – he wanted to ensure that children and families had the chance to do better and to achieve their dreams.” But his term in federal government was not without controversy. In April 2016 a coalition of 14 advocacy and civil rights groups, many of them Latino, issued a petition that made stinging criticisms of his handling of a federal program that claimed to help low-income homeowners facing foreclosure. The alliance, led by the online Hispanic campaign presente.org, Color of Change and other groups, accused Castro of being in cahoots with Wall Street over the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP). The scheme, they lamented, was selling off properties at knock-down prices to the big banks and large private equity firms, putting homeowners at risk of being turfed out. “Selling off our neighborhoods to Wall Street – at a steep discount – does not help keep people in their homes,” the petition said. The sense that he was too close to Wall Street was aggravated by the fact that the controversy erupted just when Castro was being sounded out as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton, a politician with her own Wall Street problems. In the end Clinton did not choose Castro. But the fall-out from the DASP controversy dogs him on the campaign trail. When asked about it, he points out that the program was created two years before he joined HUD, and that under his aegis several changes were made to the program that did actually help people remain in their homes. An uphill challenge The distressed asset dispute puts into relief one of the puzzles about Julián Castro – just how radical is he? In San Antonio and at HUD he gained a reputation for competency and efficiency, for executive skills that improved lives, certainly, but were more pragmatic and practical than visionary. Since he threw his hat into the presidential ring in January he has struck a much more overtly progressive pose. Like several of his Democratic rivals, he has embraced Bernie Sanders’ idea of Medicare for All designed to ensure that all Americans have healthcare. On climate change, he has said he wants to take the US back into the Paris agreement on cutting greenhouse gasses and has made positive noises about the domestic plan for net-zero emissions, the Green New Deal. He has also attached himself to reparations for descendants of slavery, saying that he favors the idea of a national commission to explore the idea and criticizing Sanders for showing hesitation. The list places Castro firmly on the resurgent left of the Democratic party. But how does that square with the image of Castro as the managerial pragmatist? The Guardian put that to him in Austin. He said: “People didn’t know where I stood on a whole bunch of issues because when I was mayor and at HUD I wasn’t asked about them. I’m going to articulate a strong vision for the country’s future that people will see is genuinely what I believe, and I think it will catch on.” His most distinctive set of policies involve immigration. As the first Latino to run a major bid for the Democratic nomination since Bill Richardson in 2008, he has been leaning on his Hispanic credentials as a point of differentiation. His first campaign trip after launching his campaign in San Antonio was to Puerto Rico, the US territory whose 3 million Spanish-speaking US citizens can take part in the primaries but are deprived the vote in the presidential election proper. Last month he made a beeline for counties in Iowa with large Latino populations. He travels to these Latino areas bearing the most robust immigration platform of any Democratic hopeful. He is proposing a Marshall Plan for Central America – an injection of resources and support for Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that provide the bulk of the migrants seeking to enter the US without visas – as an alternative to Trump’s wall. On top of that he wants to see a pathway to citizenship cleared for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the US, and a humane approach to securing the southern border through technological innovation at entry posts. Hispanic leaders hail Castro’s run as a major leap forward for a community that has for so long been ignored by presidential candidates. “You have to recognize that we are an afterthought, even though we are a huge block of 30 million eligible voters,” said Claudia Romo Edelman, an activist working to frame an Hispanic agenda for the 2020 election. “Candidates don’t focus on us, they don’t visit us, they don’t tour our businesses – so for Julián Castro to make us a primary part of his campaign, that is electric.” Electricity was in the air last month when Castro spoke to 450 mainly Latino students at UCLA. The political scientist Matt Barreto, the cofounder of the polling firm Latino Decisions who organized the event, was struck by how fired-up the audience became. “It suggested to me there’s an opportunity here for Castro to make the same appeal with Latinos that Obama did with African Americans,” he said. That’s an uphill challenge though. The legendary “sleeping giant” of the Latino electorate has disappointed many Democratic candidates by failing to rise from its slumbers. Against that tough historical record, Barreto points to a surge in Latino turnout in November’s midterm elections of 174% over 2014 figures. He also highlights the fact that California and Texas, states with enormous Hispanic populations, have both brought forward their Democratic primaries thus greatly increasing their electoral weight. Castro conceivably has a shot to provide that final chapter of his grandmother’s narrative, if he can leverage his Latino heritage to his advantage. But first he has to stay in the game long enough for his voice to be heard.",US news
"Muse 2: a wearable meditation device worthy of the Riddler I kick against meditation. I don’t know why. I am aware of the benefits for creativity and focus, and the scientific proof behind this. The alpha and theta waves produced in meditative states lead to a feeling of alert relaxation – different to what happens in the brain when you are just, say, chillaxing to Michael Ball. But it is still boring, isn’t it? Muse 2 could be perfect: it is a brain-sensing wearable device that provides live feedback (via headphones, not supplied) during guided meditations. Sounds extraordinary, looks stupid: a plastic headband with five gold chips stuck on wobbly tape, as if a child has cut up his parent’s credit cards to make a contactless tiara. Except the arms tuck behind the ears like glasses, while the band wraps around the middle of the forehead, reading the wearer’s … thoughts? It is perilously close to something the Riddler would come up with. Muse 2 bills itself as “a research-grade EEG device”, which is intimidating. The sensors on the band and arms monitor heart rate, movement, ionic currents, er, bitter thoughts and moral goodness. Or maybe I am just being paranoid. I charge it up. In the linked phone app, I select my region – the closest being Europe (sob), which is marked “50Hz”. This is probably a notch filter, to block the mains frequency, as that is not the electricity being produced in your brain, which is what it is trying to record. (But who chooses the continental standard? When will Brussels leave us to wallow in our self-inflicted hertz?) I put on the headband and instantly feel extremely self-conscious, mainly because I look like an extra on Xena the Warrior Princess. The side of the box features models of every demographic wearing the head girdle, arranged in the style of Celebrity Squares, like an equal-opps mosaic of cult members. When I switch it on, a calm Canadian voice tells me: “Muse is now listening to your brain signals.” She explains the introductory meditation: a rainfall soundscape that alters to reflect my brain activity. If I am calm, the rain gets softer and birds begin to sing. If I am distracted or agitated, the rain drums harder, like a monsoon. “Control the weather with your mind,” it instructs me, casually. I feel like Halle Berry in X-Men, or, if we are being honest, like God herself. This may be right-on, but is it healthy? There are meditations for mind, heart, body and breathing, in which users becalm the weather, settle wind chimes and slow the rhythm of healing drums. Minor movements of the eyes or tongue can contaminate EEG analysis, but it is impossible to know how well the device is adjusting for these. I devise ways to test its sensitivity. During sessions, I hyperventilate or think about Fiona Bruce’s eyebrows, to see if it registers the spikes in heart rate. I am only semi-convinced. Muse 2 is excellent at detecting shifts in body posture. There is more of a lag when it comes to mental stimulus, although the graphs at the end do roughly capture the shape of my experience. Plus, when it comes to judging electrical brain activity, I am hardly infallible myself, despite divine promotion. It is infuriating in other ways, though. Meditations are interrupted when your phone’s screen locks. It says things such as: “Unfortunately, calibration paused due to a drop in signal quality.” Imagine hearing that on the road to nirvana: you would be livid. The band is light and secure, and it is usually possible to re-establish a dropped connection. A wet finger on the sensors increases their receptivity, but dry skin or hair slows things down. Understandable, but it feels high-maintenance. I struggle with its gamification. You can rack up streaks, diamond-shaped “Muse points”, recovery rewards and wildlife icons on the app. Completing a certain number of sessions unlocks bird-themed milestones with weirdly twee names, such as “a party of jays”. Is this what happens when Angry Birds get therapy? It’s fun, but should it be? Perhaps, once the novelty wears off, this could be a useful tool for some. But I suspect the wellness vogue has arisen in response to our constant attachment to devices. It is hard to square the idea that simplicity, breath and the experience of being are best mediated by consumer electronics. Plus, I have been to parties where the jays were really flying around and I have got to say they were far more relaxing, dude. The highlight Highs and lows are sensory peaks to be steered between. Woah, this is my deepest brainwave yet. Hellness or wellness? Amusing, not amazing. 2/5",Life and style
"Intelligence report appeared to endorse view leftwing protesters were 'terrorists' An intelligence report produced for law enforcement agencies in the months before the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, in which a neo-Nazi killed one protester by driving a car into a crowd, appeared to endorse a view that leftist demonstrators were “terrorists” and at least equally as responsible for street violence as white nationalists, the Guardian can reveal. The report, Antifa/Anti-antifa: Violence in the Streets, was produced by the Regional Organized Crime Information Center (ROCIC) in May 2017. It was obtained with a Foia request from the not-for-profit transparency group Property of the People. Antifa is the name given to groups of leftwing protests who confront white nationalists, often violently. Experts say the report mischaracterizes the dynamics of the street violence that was emerging at that time, and is mistaken in characterizing white nationalist groups as “anti-antifa”, suggesting they act in opposition to leftwing groups or out of a sense of anarchism rather than having their own political and violent agenda. ROCIC is one of six Regional Intelligence Sharing System (RISS) Centers throughout the country. RISS is a federally funded program designed to share intelligence between federal, state and local agencies. ROCIC serves 14 southern states, including Virginia, the site of the 2017 Unite the Right rally. Documents accompanying the Foia request indicate that the US Secret Service was among the agencies that the report was provided to. The report frames political street violence in America as an evenly-poised battle between “antifa’s”, described as “an alliance between anarchists and communists to confront and defeat fascists and white supremacists by whatever means necessary”, and “anti-antifa, a loose collection of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, Ku Klux Klanners, white identity groups and a group called the alt-right”. The report blames the two sides equally for the violence, continuing: “So it’s the anarchists versus the nationalists, the communists versus the Nazis, the leftwing extremists versus the rightwing extremists and the confrontations are becoming more violent and destructive.” Michael German, a former FBI agent who infiltrated far right groups in the 1990s, and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the report’s framing was wrong. “Somehow they have this set up almost like antifa is the antagonist, and anti-antifa has developed to resist it,” he said “What it seems to do is completely whitewash the history of white supremacist violence in this country.” German said that framing it this way belies the way in which “far-right groups use these public spectacles as the method to incite violence. And they come knowing that it will attract protest groups from the community.” Such groups “intentionally go to places to provoke protesters to come out, and they go armed for a real street fight”, German said. The report also reproduces an opinion piece by Republican National Committee member Shawn Steel, on clashes at UC Berkeley in February 2017, first published in the conservative Washington Times. The excerpted text reads “the mob of antifa terrorists that violently attacked the [student union] … were as much declaring war on the ideology of the man for whom the building is named (Martin Luther King) and its citizens. America’s left was sending a message: Violence is the answer.” The report takes the description of anti-fascists as “terrorists” at face value, something many experts disagree with. Mark Bray, a lecturer at Dartmouth College and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, said the “anti-antifa” designation for American far-right groups is also potentially misleading. “I don’t get the sense that that is the main source of their self-identification,” he said. The report makes further assertions about the relationship between the groups that experts say are unsupported by facts. At one point, the report says: “The antifa can be considered leftwing anarchism and the anti-antifa can be considered rightwing anarchism.” Bray said: “That’s ludicrous … most of these rightwing groups are not opposed to the state as a form of social organization. Many of them are fascists of some sort or another and believe in a strong state.” Shane Burley, the author of Fascism Today: What it is and how to fight it, agreed, saying that “this idea that it’s rightwing anarchists, that’s not a phenomenon, that’s not a thing that actually exists”. The report is heavily redacted, but spends much of its unredacted length discussing alleged antifascist violence, and sometimes implicitly blames those groups for violence visited upon them. At one point, it focuses in particular on an event in Sacramento in June 2016, which led the FBI to open a controversial investigation on a leftwing group. At that time, groups including By Any Means Necessary (Bamn) organized a counter-protest against a white supremacist rally which included members of the Traditionalist Workers party and the Golden State Skinheads, some of whom were wielding knives. Several people were stabbed at the event, including at least seven counter-protesters. Following this event, California law enforcement cooperated with neo-Nazis to identify counter-protesters, pursued charges against counter-protesters, including stabbing victims and did not prosecute neo-Nazis over the stabbings. In February, the Guardian revealed that the FBI had responded to the event by surveilling and investigating Bamn. In the ROCIC report there is also no discussion of the specific groups actively organizing the Unite the Right rally not long after the report’s publication date. Neo-confederate groups such as the League of the South; neo-Nazi and Identitarian groups such as Vanguard America, the National Socialist Movement, the Rise Above Movement and Identity Evropa; and street-fighting groups such as the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights and the Proud Boys are not mentioned. All of these groups were involved in the demonstration in Charlottesville, which culminated in the killing of Heather Heyer by James Alex Fields, who marched with Vanguard America. The report also extensively sources information from conservative media and rightwing advocacy groups. It quotes a report from Glenn Beck’s the Blaze, which cites the Washington Times, and Laura Ingraham’s conservative lifestyle website LifeZette alongside more reputable sources, including the Guardian. Bray criticized the thinness of the report’s sourcing. “There’s a wealth of literature out there about the nature of far-right politics in Europe and the United States. It just sounds like someone got tasked with Googling this,” he added. Ryan Shapiro, the executive director of Property of the People, which sourced the documents, said: “US intelligence agencies have a long, sad history of targeting progressive movements as threats to American security” Neither ROCIC nor RISS replied to repeated requests for comment on the report.",World news
"‘The metro smashed the old rules’: Indian women drive change – and trains Down on the platform, where the air is intensely muggy in the March heat, a train glides in. The driver is a woman. The ticket office is run by a woman. A transgender woman helps customers at the inquiry desk. On four of the metro’s stations, passengers can go into a special cubicle to breastfeed their babies. At the station, Rejitha, dressed in a turquoise and pink uniform, is on hand to help the hundreds of people who use the Kochi Metro every day. “See, you place it flat like this on the sensor to get through,” she tells a customer struggling to get through the ticket barrier. Clockwise from left: Kochi Metro train driver Hima C; a metro worker helps a passenger through the ticket barrier at Aluva station; the customer care centre at Aluva station; a customer care worker at Muttom station An army of women make up about 80% of the 1,300-strong metro workforce. From cleaning posts to senior management roles – aside from the managing director, who is a man – this is an operation conceived to give women more job opportunities. “It’s a safe and clean environment for me. The money I get makes a big difference to our budget and to what I can do for my family,” says Rejitha, who goes by a single name. Passengers walk past a breastfeeding pod at Aluva metro station in Kochi The predominance of women explains the decision to install the breastfeeding pods, equipped with a seat, fan, and phone charging point. The pods are located in parts of stations that can be accessed without a ticket so that any passing woman who needs it can walk in off the street and use it. “We realised that breastfeeding rates were coming down in Kerala and wondered if we could help. If demand goes up, we will install more of them,” says Sumi Nadarajan, senior deputy general manager for planning and sustainability. Plants are seen on the pillars of Palarivattom metro station This sensitivity typifies many of the state-owned metro’s policies. It was an unusual infrastructure project from the outset. In a country where projects routinely run over budget and break deadlines, the metro was completed within the agreed cost and time constraints. It uses solar power for 35% of its energy needs, and more than 200 of the pillars dotted around the station have been turned into vertical gardens with the use of compost made from municipal waste. One key decision was to train and appoint female drivers: seven out of the 39 drivers are women. Another was hiring 60 transgender women, the first time any company in India has formally decided to hire along such lines. As former metro managing director Elias George said at the time, “society’s mindset will change only by direct interaction with” transgender people. In a move to give further jobs to women, the metro joined up with a women’s collective called Kudumbashree to supply meals. Women cook lunches in their homes and, travelling on the metro, deliver the meals in steel “tiffin” boxes (to avoid plastic) to metro employees at various stations. They earn money and metro employees enjoy home-cooked food. Members of the Kudumbhashree women’s collective make and distribute lunches for Koshi Metro staff “From day one, we believed the policies that shape this institution must be progressive and innovative and aimed at social inclusion and women’s empowerment,” says Kochi Metro managing director Mohammed Hanish. Bringing Kerala’s transgender people into the public eye has not been easy. Unlike in other parts of India, transgender people here live hidden away. “In north India, transgenders live in communities called hamams but in Kerala they are solitary and isolated,” says Sumi Mohan, board member of human rights organisation Sahayatrika. The attrition rate among transgender employees has been high. Finding affordable accommodation near the station where they work was a problem for many. “It was a challenge keeping them employed. Many took lots of medical leave. They need surgery or they have issues with their hormone treatment. And they wanted a daily wage. They live from hand to mouth and can’t wait for a month before being paid. But we couldn’t change the rules for just one section of employees,” says Natarajan. Kothi Metro employee Karthika poses at Changampuzha Park station As a result, only a dozen remain. One of them is Karthika Raghavan, 36, who gave up her job as a biochemist in a laboratory, because it was too solitary, to work as a customer assistant on the metro. Raghavan’s parents accepted her and she continues to live with them, something of a rarity among transgender people in Kerala. “My job in the lab was with non-living things. Being out and meeting all kinds of people on the metro makes me feel happy,” she says in fluent English. “Whenever I used to look for jobs, the ad specified male or female. The Kochi Metro has smashed all the old rules by giving us work.” The metro’s policies stem from a wider progressive ethos that is perhaps unique to Kerala. Although the state has been in the news recently for the campaign by women to win the right to pray at the Sabarimala temple, where women have been denied entry for decades, this is something of an aberration. The state has a high female literacy rate, low maternal and infant mortality, and a healthy sex ratio compared with other Indian states. Nevertheless, few women, despite being educated, feature in the labour force. According to the latest official data for 2011-12, 22% of women work in the formal sector in rural areas, compared with 56% of men, lower than the 25% figure for India as a whole. This is why the Kochi Metro made a conscious effort to give jobs to women. There has been no shortage of takers. Women even work the night shift, which is notable in a society where you rarely see women out after sunset in rural areas. Hima C, as she is known, is a 27-year-old driver – an assistant “loco-pilot”, as it is called. The shifts don’t bother her because she loves her job. “The metro is elevated, so it soars over the city. I love that sense of space – and the way people on the platform, when they see the train rolling in, smile and wave at me,” she says. Raghavan also has no problem with shift work. “I want to be trained as a driver. That’s the next logical step and that’s my new ambition,” she says.",Global development

"ABC inquiry critical of 'captain's pick' board appointments Appointments to the ABC board must be transparent and directors should have media experience, a Senate inquiry into allegations of political interference has recommended. The inquiry, which was established by the Greens, Labor and the crossbench late last year after the crisis that led to the departure of the managing director, Michelle Guthrie, and chairman, Justin Milne, found that the appointment process “should incorporate higher standards of transparency and accountability”. Guthrie alleged Milne had told her to sack ABC journalists – including Emma Alberici and Andrew Probyn – whom the government didn’t like. The report tabled on Monday afternoon recommends the prime minister consult the leader of the opposition during the nomination process, to prevent political appointments. Milne was a friend of the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, and several of the board’s directors were appointed by bypassing the independent nominations panel. The committee heard that provisions in the ABC Act “enable the government to exert political influence” by ignoring the recommendations of the panel. The appointments of Donny Walford, Vanessa Guthrie and Joseph Gersh were ministerial appointments by Mitch Fifield, and the new chair, Ita Buttrose, was chosen by Scott Morrison. “The committee expresses grave concern that, notwithstanding the events of 2018 and this contemporaneous inquiry, the prime minister has chosen to make yet another so-called ‘captain’s pick’,” the report said. The Greens made further recommendations, including fully restoring the $340m in funding the Coalition has cut since 2014; ensuring funding for overseas broadcasting is given to the ABC and not commercial broadcasters; and a transition from triennial funding to a five-year funding cycle to give the broadcaster more stability. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who chaired the inquiry, said it was clear the ABC had been “under pressure from political interference and funding instability”. “The Morrison government has the opportunity to lock in funding for a five-year period and restore what has been cut in this week’s budget. Anything less is a kick in the guts to the millions of Australians who love and rely on the ABC. “This inquiry has shown that the ABC is seen as the government’s plaything, when in fact it is owned by the Australian people. It is heartening that ABC staff stood up for the organisation’s independence, warding off political interference attempts. But they should be able to do their jobs, without fear or favour.” The broadcaster’s acting managing director, David Anderson, told the committee’s public hearings the current funding arrangement meant the broadcaster was vulnerable to the whims of whatever government was in power. The committee heard Milne displayed a lack of understanding of his role as chair. “Nobody has told me that I’m supposed to be a wall,” Milne told Four Corners after he resigned. “I think, more what I’m likely to be is a conduit … It’s necessary, and I think it’s the role of the board to be a conduit so that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.” But the committee heard from a group of former staff, ABC Alumni, that the ABC “is not ‘the left hand’ of the government as Mr Milne implies”. The report is critical of the board’s response to Guthrie’s presentation of a dossier days before she was sacked in which she documented the disintegration of her relationship with Milne. “The committee is astounded that the ABC board did not make further inquiries – both before and after presentation of the dossier – about the source of this tension that was so clearly impacting the corporation and which clearly could have, and did, jeopardise the independence of key personnel.” The committee heard evidence that the ABC’s complaints handling process was being misused and senior ABC staff were “routinely handling complaints from politicians and/or their offices”. ABC Alumni told the inquiry the pressures on staff had made them more timid. “The strain of treading a line between the charter requirements … and making do with increasingly less funding, combined with the need for consequent staffing losses and diminished resources for program-making, have taken a heavy toll. Such an environment can breed timidity because of the apparently well-founded fear that giving offence to government might result in further assaults on the ABC’s independence, funding and functions.”",Media
"Budget 2019 to soften superannuation rules for over 65s The Morrison government will use Tuesday’s budget to allow 65 and 66 year olds to make voluntary superannuation contributions without meeting the current work test. The proposal, to take effect from 2020-21, is part of the government’s efforts to court older voters ahead of the looming federal election, and potentially benefits 55,000 people. The same cohort will be permitted to make three years’ worth of non-concessional contributions, which are currently capped at $100,000 a year, to their super accounts in one year. At the moment, only people under 65 can access those arrangements. The government also intends to increase the age limit for spousal contributions from 69, where it is currently, to 74. At the moment, people aged over 70 can’t receive contributions made by someone else on their behalf. The Morrison government is hoping Tuesday night’s budget – which will contain tax cuts, cash payments and a significant infrastructure spend – will revive its political fortunes ahead of the election, which is widely tipped to be called this weekend. The prime minister told reporters on Monday the budget would deliver the first surplus in 12 years. Morrison declared the Coalition had “been most successful of any government in 50 years in keeping expenditure under control”. He said the government would deliver a sound economic statement because expenditure was restrained, people were getting off welfare on to work, and the government had supported growth in the economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the super changes would help Australians boost their retirement savings by giving them greater flexibility as they neared retirement. Frydenberg has done nothing to hose down expectations of tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners, which would come on top of $285m in one-off payments to pensioners and other welfare recipients, except those on Newstart.",Australia news
"Favourite places in the UK: readers’ travel tips Winning tip: Great Orme, Llandudno, Conwy A short, steep walk from Llandudno’s pier to the top of the Great Orme headland brings multiple rewards. The seaside resort is quickly left behind to reveal a peaceful landscape filled with possibilities. Walk among limestone pavements, and look down to notice the planned street pattern and evidence of ancient copper works. Pockets of wildflowers abound. Stroll steep cliffs to view soaring razorbills and kittiwakes. Spot local landmarks: the castle and estuary at Conwy, the straits separating Anglesey from the mainland. Watch the sun set from St Tudno’s, the 12th-century chapel. Descend to see wild Kashmiri goats and the remnants of a second world war practice camp along the shore. Britain in miniature. Judith Climb Snowdon with the crowds Most people head to the mountains to avoid crowds, but for an experience that encapsulates the UK at its best, why not embrace them and climb Snowdon on a sunny bank holiday. It will restore your faith in humanity. England &amp; Wales’ highest peak attracts walkers of all persuasions: teenage charity hikers, families climbing their first mountain, retirees with decades-old backpacks. All exhausted, proud and politely taking it in turns to have a selfie on the crowded trig point. It’s also diverse; unlike on many UK peaks, not every face you see is white, and a mountain railway makes the summit accessible to all. The views aren’t bad either … Kirstie Fagan Gallery and cake, Isle of Skye The mood changes from heavy clouds swirling menacingly overhead to sapphire blue clarity in the time it takes to consume one of the tasty homemade cakes and pots of tea at the warm and welcoming Ellishadder Gallery on Skye. The dramatic, brooding backdrop of the Quiraing, with its pinnacles, crests and buttresses, is framed in the windows, contrasting with the pretty, colourful garden where vegetables and herbs are grown to flavour delicious soups. Buy one of the owner’s expertly woven throws in subtle hues of blue, green and grey reflecting the splendour of this Hebridean isle and you have a small slice of heaven. Carol Morris Easdale Island, Highlands This is the most magical place for families. A tiny slate island near Oban, it is car-free (if staying, you transport your luggage via wheelbarrow). There is the lovely Puffer bar/restaurant for refreshments, and a great arts centre with a surprising range of events for such a rural location. The World Stone Skimming championships every September draws the crowds, but the island is even more charming when normal service resumes – a great spot for fishing, wild swimming in a quarry and wildlife-spotting on the stony beaches and footpaths. To see dolphins, whales and the Corryvreckan Whirlpool, visitors can join a seafari tour, leaving from Easdale. Claire Birmingham’s Back to Backs The UK to me means family and making the best of what you’ve got. I find all that in the 19th- and 20th-century working class homes at Birmingham’s Back to Backs (adult £9.50, child £5.25), restored and maintained by the National Trust. We’ve been coming for more than a decade, and the experience still enthrals everyone we bring. My 87-year-old father pictures his mum’s family of 10 living in these minuscule dwellings, playing in the courtyard and sharing primitive toilet facilities; my grandson can’t believe “glass eye-maker” was ever a profession; and I look forward to some 1970s and earlier confectionery in the sweet shop. The building of homes like these was banned in the 19th century – yet people still lived here into the late 20th century, with the last occupant, a tailor originally from St Kitts, leaving in 2001. How they evaded the city’s slum-clearing zeal is miraculous. Stan Jones Big Stone, Tatham fells, North Yorkshire From this glacial erratic, also called the Great Stone of Fourstones, you can see the Lakeland pikes, the majestic three peaks of the Yorkshire Dales, the rolling moors of the Forest of Bowland, and over to Morecambe Bay, the Heysham power station and the Lune river winding through villages. The wind sweeps to distant turbines; curlews and lapwings call out as they ride the air currents. This is a vista that shows off our diverse geology and geography; you can stand on an erratic abandoned here 20,000 years ago and gaze at this panorama of northern splendour. A popular walk to the Big Stone starts from the Slaidburn to Bentham road. Melissa Bailey Great loos at the Philharmonic pub, Liverpool The Philharmonic Dining Rooms, opposite the eponymous concert hall, is a Nicholson’s pub with real Victorian grandeur and ornate decor of mahogany, glass and copper. It has perhaps the most beautiful pub toilets in the country, with lots of marble features. Opened at the turn of the 20th century, this must be one of England’s most remarkable pubs. It has a large range of craft brews and gins, too. Liam Wasdale Head, Cumbria Many people consider this area the birthplace of British climbing, and I love following the trails once trodden by Victorian boots but now by synthetic soles. Beyond the inn and farms is an outdoor cathedral of many spires, Pillar, Kirk Fell and Great Gable. To stand beneath the often cloud-soaked summits gives such a feeling of permanence and reminds me how transient our difficulties are. Whichever route you take offers an arduous walk but rewards of achievement and breathtaking views – views that will remain long after our troubled times have made their exit. Tim Spindler Portencross, Seamill, North Ayrshire The coastal strip by 14th-century Portencross Castle is my favourite place in the world. I have been going ever since I can remember. The fortress stands firm, rising from craggy rocks. Quaint fisherman’s cottages sit adjacent, painted in soft pastels with nets and lobster pots littering the gardens. Sailboats and launches bob in the nearby harbour, painted in vibrant blues and reds that punctuate the otherwise soft, natural tones of the coastline. If you want to escape urban life, it’s the perfect destination. Alex Kyrtsoudis Grassmarket, Edinburgh Every weekend I have the joy of running a stall in the historic Grassmarket. Rugby fans pack into cosy pubs for the Six Nations; tourists snap pictures of the Castle; thespians flock to watch street performers; and locals sit in cafes watching the world go by. Now a trendy hangout, the Grassmarket has glimpses of its dark past – it was used for public hangings and suffered a bombing raid by a Zeppelin airship in the first world war. Old tales (the woman who “woke up” after her hanging and was released is a favourite) are kept alive by locals and tour guides, but this historic quarter equally represents the modern age. With a range of traders, you can find the best street food in Edinburgh and sample local beers. Lou Harkins John Rylands Library, Manchester I was a student at Manchester University, but it was only once I’d made Manchester my permanent home that I visited the John Rylands Library. This neo-Gothic masterpiece, which opened in 1900, is managed by the university as a free museum. It’s a compact and moody place, with arched corridors, high ceilings and hidden alcoves. Built by Enriqueta Rylands as a memorial to her industrialist/philanthropist husband (John Rylands, the city’s first multimillionaire, built up the UK’s largest textile business), this is one of the more unusual buildings in a city that led the industrial revolution and was the first industrialised city in the world. John Hewitt Gaping Gill, Yorkshire Dales This hole in the Earth has remoteness, one of the UK’s largest waterfalls (the highest unbroken in England), and the largest underground chamber in the UK that’s naturally open at the top. An hour’s walk from lovely Clapham village, Gaping Gill is on the lower slopes of Ingleborough, the Dales’ second-highest peak, if you fancy some extra exertion. On bank holiday weekends a local potholing club will usually have set up a winch to lower you to the bottom for a fee. They also set up lights to help you enjoy this awesome natural wonder. Ian Murray Spurn Point, near Hull Solitude and peace are abundant here. The remains of cracked and broken wartime defences give way to the beauty of this ribbon of land. I just love the contrasts here. Open sea at one side, heavy and grey, with flotsam to search through; longer sand flats on the estuary side with birds feeding, circling and landing. Walk from the RSPB visitors centre, or catch the all-terrain bus to the actual point. • discoveryorkshirecoast.com Steve Berwickshire coastal path A seat on a train between Newcastle and Edinburgh is one of the most scenic places you can sit. Vast seascapes lead to the grand view of Berwick’s walled town, the point of the ritual crossing the border over the Tweed. Berwickshire is an obsolete Scots county named after an English town. Its coastal fringe is nothing less than magnificent. Go back and walk a bit of it in more detail from Cove to Pease Bay. Learn of fishwives looking out to the horizon for lost souls. Feel the wind in your hair. View harbours, banded cliffs, beaches – breathtaking round every bend. • walkhighlands.co.uk Kay Williams Hastings old town I never get tired of Hastings old town and the beach and fishing boats there. It is a vibrant, lively place. The High Street and George Street are filled with independent cafes, bookshops, fashion stores, art galleries and jewellers. The pubs are warm, welcoming and filled with historical echoes of the fishing and smuggling trade. Most pubs in the old town were used for smuggling, and stories of deceit, betrayal and death are kept alive by the local people who know the fascinating history. Any local will know the stories and every time they visit a shop or pub in the old town, they will see or feel a reminder of this never-forgotten past. Rachel Marsh Quiet art gallery, Cornwall Penlee Gallery in Penzance offers much more than an escape from Cornish rain: the exhibitions consistently capture the spirit of Cornwall past and present, its landscapes and people. Set in gardens, it provides respite from the beach and complements coast path rambles. The collection of Newlyn School pictures changes regularly, and themed exhibitions offer rare opportunities to see artworks from the same school together that are normally scattered through public and private collections. It is small enough and quiet enough that you can take your time and experience the diversity of art inspired by Cornwall. The cafe and shop are worth a visit, too. • £5 adult, under-18s free, penleehouse.org.uk Susan Lane",Travel
"Monday briefing: Tory chief whip says softer Brexit ‘inevitable’ Top story: Besieged May aims to push deal for fourth time Good morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and this is all the news you can use on this first day of April. British summer time might have arrived but British politics is still stuck in an endless winter of discontent. As the process to decide how – or if – the UK leaves the EU drags on, the cabinet is split between remainers who want to force an option based on a customs union and Brexiters pushing for a no deal. Theresa May, still hoping to pass her deal at the fourth attempt this week, appears helpless to bring them into line with the rival camps threatening mass resignations if they don’t get their way. The action moves back to parliament later today when MPs are due to hold indicative votes on Brexit options. They range from a customs union to no deal on 12 April, to a second referendum to revoking article 50 and postponing Brexit. David Gauke, the justice secretary and leading remainer, warned that it was “not sustainable” for May to ignore the will of the Commons if MPs voted for a customs union. In another twist, Julian Smith, the chief whip, told the BBC that a softer Brexit was “inevitable” after the government lost its majority after the 2017 election. Our political editor, Heather Stewart, picks through the ruins as she looks at what might happen next. She concludes that no one knows the path we will take if May’s deal falls again. Columnist John Harris, meanwhile, despairs that the country has not been angry enough about Brexit, instead falling back on world-weary humour to deal with the crisis. But if you’ve had enough of Brexit, don’t worry: a secret working party drawn from Britain’s leading institutions is developing plans for a “healing tsar” to reunite the divided nation. Based on an idea first floated by Prince Charles, insiders say the role could be filled by Bob Geldof or Chumbawamba singer Alice Nutter or former Dollar vocalist David Van Day. * * * Health duty – Public sector workers such as teachers, nurses and police officers will be required by law to “spot warning signs” of violent crime among young people, under government plans to be announced today. The signs that a young person could be in danger could include presenting at hospital with a suspicious injury, to worrying behaviour at school or issues at home. Staff could be held accountable for failing to act on what the government is calling a “public health duty”. It comes as Sajid Javid granted police new powers to increase stop and search activity following a spate of bloodshed across London and the rest of England since the start of 2019. * * * Election dramas – Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has used every conceivable ruse to shore up his support in Turkey’s local elections, but it looks as though his hardline message has been rejected by voters in the two main cities. Erdoğan claimed overall victory on Sunday night after his ruling AKP took nearly 45% of the votes compared with 30% for the main opposition, with 90% of ballots counted. But recounts seem likely today as the opposition claimed victory in Istanbul and Ankara in what would be the first significant defeat for his party since coming to power in 2002. In Ukraine, an actor and comedian whose only political experience is playing the role of president in a TV drama series, is leading the first ballot in the presidential election. With 11% of the ballots counted, Volodymyr Zelensky has 29% and will likely run off later this month against either incumbent president Petro Poroshenko or former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, Slovakia has elected its first female leader. * * * ‘You can’t mix’ – The row about social segregation in housing developments has deepened as people living in shared ownership apartments complain that they are shut out of facilities such as gyms, car parks and gardens. Segregation is often enforced through the use of electronic keys allocated only to private householders with shared owners obliged to use separate entrances or “poor doors” used in social housing. “You can’t mix with other people and it feels segregated,” said Gautama Payment, 35, who lives with his wife and three children at the Vista development in Battersea, west London. * * * Kim case over – A Vietnamese woman who is the only suspect in custody for the killing of the North Korean leader’s brother has admitted to a lesser charge in a Malaysian court this morning. Doan Thi Huong nodded as a translator read the new charge of voluntarily causing injury in the death of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. She had faced a murder charge but is now expected to be freed next month. It follows the acquittal of another suspect, Indonesian woman Siti Aisyah, last month. * * * Liars and a cheat – A study of 40,000 teenagers claims that North Americans are the biggest liars in the world, while British youngsters rank mid-table in the list of shame. Researchers asked participants how much they understood of mathematical concepts but included three fake topics in the list to flush out the worst fibbers. They may have been inspired by the person a new book calls the Commander in Cheat, which claims that Donald Trump is the “world’s worst golf cheat”. Written by award-winning journalist Rick O’Reilly, who has played with Trump, it quotes examples from professional Brad Faxon, Samuel L Jackson and the musician Alice Cooper.

"Five ways to get more fibre in your diet Get a feel for the figures Fibre, or roughage, refers to indigestible carbohydrates. A fibre-rich diet is linked to health benefits including a reduced risk of heart disease and bowel cancer. While UK guidelines say adults should get 30g a day, fewer than one in 10 meet this goal. Popular low-carb diets may be a reason why. Understanding what is in your food can help: a typical apple contains 2-3g of fibre, a sesame bagel about 4g. Jo Greening, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association (BDA), says it is worth checking the labels, as different brands have different levels of fibre. Switch to wholegrain Simple substitutions can boost your fibre intake without you radically rethinking your diet. By moving to bran flakes from rice puffs for breakfast, wholemeal rather than white bread for a sandwich at lunchtime, and brown rice instead of white for dinner, you can raise your fibre intake by several grams. Top up your meals Greening recommends adding a handful of raisins or nuts to breakfast cereals, seeds to salads, and chickpeas or lentils to a stew. “Half a can of chickpeas is about 7g of fibre – and that can help to reduce the amount of meat you are adding,” she says, adding that bulking meals out with vegetables helps. “Have baked beans on two slices of toast and you are already at 13g.” Keeping the skins on potatoes also adds fibre to a meal. Ditch the juicer for a blender Greening says it is better to eat fruit as solids rather than turn them into drinks, as juicing makes the sugar in fruit much more readily available. If you can’t give up slurping, go for a blender. “Juicers remove a lot of the fibre, whereas blending smoothies keeps the fibre in there,” says Prof Pete Wilde of the Quadram Institute. To keep sugars down, he says, it is better to use low-sugar fruit or even just vegetables. Take it slowly To avoid digestive problems such as bloating, gas and diarrhoea, Greening says it is important to increase fibre gradually, rather than boosting consumption suddenly. Consume plenty of fluids, too: the BDA recommends 8 to 10 cups a day, at regular intervals.",Life and style
"Shared ownership households complain of housing segregation People living in shared ownership homes are being denied access to open spaces, car parks, gymnasiums and swimming pools, fuelling complaints of housing segregation. Residents who own homes outright enjoy access to the facilities in complexes that often feature side or rear entrances for shared owners, like “poor doors” used in social housing. But householders who own only a part of their homes have complained of the daily frustration and discrimination they feel at the practices. Segregation is often achieved through electronic key fobs that are programmed to deny access to parts of complexes. Examples include: A family denied a space in a parking garage – a large part of which is occupied by a single collection of sports cars under dustsheets, including a Lamborghini, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. Shared ownership residents refused access to the only gym in the area even though it is part of “a contemporary village hall” that the developers had touted as “where individuals become communities”. A landlord refusing to allow shared ownership residents to use the main entrance when their door was broken. “You can’t mix with other people and it feels segregated,” said Gautama Payment, 35, who lives with his wife and three children at the Vista development in Battersea, west London. “We never had the option to be able to access the gym, the pool, the concierge or the sunken garden.” At the Lighterman development on the Greenwich peninsula, Ken MacArthur, a 53-year-old NHS worker, lives in one of about 20 shared ownership flats that have a separate, more spartan entrance to the private flats, where a suited concierge sits behind a marble desk, there are soft furnishings and smart lighting. MacArthur and his neighbours are denied access to the rooftop garden enjoyed by the private flats and the gym which on one day last week were only used by one person. “We want to build a community here and things have to be inclusive,” he said. “There shouldn’t be discrimination based on what building you are in. They are talking about building 15,000 homes here. It’s a lot of people and they all have to get on with each other and they all have to have their needs met. This is a form of discrimination.” The cases come amid outrage at social housing tenants being banned from using playgrounds reserved for private owners. It has prompted dozens of social tenants and private owners to highlight similar practices where they live. In one case in Hackney Wick, east London, pregnant and disabled social housing tenants in a block called Legacy House, dominated by privately owned flats, have been made to use stairs to access their floor because the lift was designed to stop only on private floors. Thomas Reames, a 42-year-old social tenant, said they were being treated like “lesser beings”. “We have to go through seven doors to our front door of our home,” he said. “There are five residents on this floor and all five have young children.” Following pressure from residents and a ruling that the decision breached planning rules, the block’s developer, the Anderson Group, said last week it would make alterations so the lift stopped at the first floor. Shared ownership can involve householders paying hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy a percentage of their home while paying the rest in rent to a registered social landlord. At least 200,000 households have bought into the system nationwide in order to get on to the housing ladder, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The Payments own 40% of their flat but the concierge does not take parcels for them, couriers are not allowed to leave them in the separate entrance to their flats and there is no loading zone. They park their family car 10 minutes away. The entrance to their flats is around the back of the building facing the railway tracks, while the entrance to the fully owned flats fronts on to a landscaped garden. The developer, Berkeley Homes, said it “supports diverse communities and opposes segregation”. It said a new public park was due to open this summer “for every child to enjoy”. The social landlord, Peabody, said it had “reduced rents significantly to ensure they are genuinely affordable for working Londoners” and said that increasing service charges would only prevent people moving on to the housing ladder. The developer at the Lighterman, Knight Dragon, said the affordable housing provider, L&amp;Q, decides what services are offered to residents, with affordability being key. L&amp;Q said it would consider residents’ “strong views” about amenities in future “whilst ensuring there is adequate provision of affordable housing”. At New Providence Wharf, a development by Ballymore in Tower Hamlets, a solicitor in the social housing block, which includes shared ownership and has its own rear entrance backing on to a dual carriageway, said: “We are made to feel like second-class citizens.” They are not allowed to use the gym or the swimming pool and are not allowed to use the car park that is directly beneath their building. “The idea that there is a poor door is horrible,” he said. “It doesn’t create a nice atmosphere to live in and there’s a feeling of them and us.” People in the shared ownership flats pay an annual service charge of over £3,000, most of which covers the whole complex and part of which is understood to fund the upkeep of a grand water feature by the main door which they are not allowed to use to get to their homes. Ballymore said the firm had no policy on restricting access to residents of any tenure and decisions about setting service charges at a level that includes access to gyms, pools or other amenities lies with their housing association. Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: “Segregation and discrimination are entrenched within our broken housing system whether against social tenants in the state sector or benefit recipients in private renting. We hear countless stories from parents and families who feel stigmatised just because they don’t have the luxury of owning their home. Yet everyone should have the right to a safe and secure place to raise their children and call home as part of a thriving, inclusive community.”",Society
"When I could barely look in the mirror, hot yoga untangled my darkest thoughts
 Late 2012 was the bleakest time I had ever known. Over weeks that became months, I waited for my divorce to be finalised and meanwhile my mind unravelled. I found it hard to write, think, eat or take pleasure in anything; I could not imagine what it would be like to feel happy again; I could not find any hope or purpose. I struggle now to remember why one Monday morning around that time I decided to head to a hot yoga studio in east London and sign up for a 30-day trial. I do not remember the class, how much I sweated nor how terrible I was. But I do know that I began going to hot yoga every day. Sometimes, when my head felt as if it might collapse, I went twice. I skipped parties, left social events and got up hideously early to attend. There was something about the hot room that held me together, that stopped all the dark thoughts tangling around my insides. The kind of hot yoga I chose was the Bikram method: a set of 26 postures and two breathing exercises performed over 90 minutes in heat that hovers between 35C and 42C with 40% humidity. It is a contentious form of yoga following its founder Bikram Choudhury’s failed attempt to copyright his method, and the numerous claims of sexual assault against him, beginning in 2013. Many studios have understandably sought to distance themselves from the Bikram brand, renaming the classes “Hot 26”. Even before the exposé, many practitioners claimed that Bikram was not real yoga. Some questioned the limitations of just 26 postures and an accompanying script learned and delivered rote-like by teachers. Others wondered why the class had to be performed before a wall of mirrors, as if it might be more of an exercise in vanity than a moving meditation. I understand such suspicions, perhaps even once felt them myself, but my Bikram experience was transformative. Something in the rigorous repetition of those 26 postures freed my mind, dragged me out of the mire of my thoughts and back into the present. I was able to focus on how each day my body behaved differently. How on Tuesday morning my standing bow might be unwavering, then on Wednesday afternoon I might fall out of the posture twice, but find I had somehow advanced in triangle pose. The mirrors are perhaps harder to explain, especially in a class so sweltering it demands that practitioners wear minimal clothing. But believe me when I say that you do not spend those 90 minutes admiring your physique; rather you use the mirrors as an aid to focusing on the minutiae of your postures. At a point when I could barely look at myself, the necessity of staring at a mirror each day brought me a kind of self-acceptance that I had never experienced before. I felt as if I were finally befriending myself. There were physical changes, too: I became lean and poised, my skin glowed, I had more energy and I slept well. Getting dressed was no longer a process of hiding my body and I had a surging sense of invincibility. I prided myself on being able to bound up escalators without breaking a sweat or pausing for breath. I became the kind of evangelical fool who implores near-strangers to try their favourite form of exercise. I found a physical ease I don’t think I’ve had since I was a child. I discovered the intense euphoria that follows a class and the particular joy that accompanies a post-Bikram beer. For three and a half years, until I moved away from London, I maintained a near-daily practice. Today, although I generally manage to make a class about three times a week, I still find the hardest part of my relocation the absence of Bikram. A physical and mental sluggishness descends when I do not practise daily. Lately, I’ve explored other forms of hot yoga: vinyasa flow, Forrest, power, classes performed in less ferocious heat, sometimes in inflatable pods, often to music. And although I have yet to love them as fiercely as the Bikram method, I try to remind myself of the importance of being open to something new and potentially wonderful. I try to remember the woman I was in late 2012, half-broken, walking into an unfamiliar yoga studio. I remind myself how much has changed since then, how much I have changed, the fearlessness I have found. When I describe that time to people, I tell them that when my brain was broken I focused on my body until my mind returned to me. I tell them how hot yoga not only changed my life; I genuinely feel it saved it, too.",Life and style
"To understand the far right, look to their bookshelves I used to live in Tucson, teaching at the University of Arizona. The post-9/11 US, just half an hour away from the Mexican border, was a strange place to be. Armed vigilantes patrolled the desert hunting for illegal immigrants. Every day the local radio spewed paranoia and xenophobia. They talked about “true Americans” in small towns with “pure values”, as opposed to the corrupt liberal elite in the cities. A radical-right rhetoric was beginning to form, but it was still on the margins. Poll after poll showed that trust in basic democratic institutions was diminishing. It was against this background that the rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh claimed there were “four corners of deceit”: media, academia, science and government. Conspiracy theories mushroomed about how “liberal lobbies” had usurped the system. Populist demagogues began to advise building alternative rightwing institutions. A parallel universe. Information wars. Culture and knowledge, which have for centuries bound us together as human beings, were now regarded as a battleground. Since then the radical right has seeped into the mainstream. A new breed of populist demagogue has arisen, with no care for facts, reason or data. Yet alongside this has been a silent shift: the emergence of a radical rightwing intelligentsia. With their books and talks they bridge the less-educated groups on the margins and the world of letters. A new publishing trend has emerged, and part of its task is to rewrite history. In 2018, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s memoir Son of the Nation came out in France. The first edition sold out even before it arrived in bookshops. The book was, among other things, an attempt to rewrite the past, particularly the Vichy era. Nazi sympathisers in the Vichy government were romanticised as true French patriots. Le Pen himself has repeatedly denied the Holocaust, and calls the Nazi gas chambers “just a detail” in the history of the second world war. A similar attempt to reconstruct the past is taking place in Poland. In her books and talks, the historian Ewa Kurek claims the ghettos were “voluntary” and life was more difficult for Poles living outside the ghettos than it was for the Jews inside. As a novelist I am particularly interested in how fiction fits into the new rightwing publishing. Hard though it is to admit for those of us who believe in the positive impact of books, today the art of storytelling is being used to spread hatred, bigotry and misinformation. That in itself is nothing new. The Turner Diaries, a dystopian novel regarded as the bible of the far right, is a 1978 novel by WL Pierce (writing as Andrew Macdonald). It depicts a future society where white Americans have been subdued by non-white minorities. The dominance of these minorities is opposed by an armed movement named “the Order”, which eventually carries out a genocide of all non-white people. The book has inspired a series of terrorist attacks, including the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, in which 168 people died. A white nationalist group that called themselves the Order murdered Alan Berg, a liberal lawyer and anchorman, in 1984. The Camp of the Saints, a 1973 novel by the French writer and explorer Jean Raspail, was recently rediscovered and repackaged by the far right. It has since sold in huge numbers, thanks to an endorsement from Steve Bannon. It, too, describes the collapse of western civilisation at the hands of “brown people”. Raspail, now 93, claims that the solution to today’s problems lies in suppressing compassion. “I have written that Christian charity will suffer a bit when faced with the answers to the influx of migrants. It will have to steel itself and suppress compassion of all sorts. Otherwise, our countries will be submerged.” Few books in this new trend have been more influential than those written by the French novelist and essayist Renaud Camus. Camus, an ardent supporter of Marine Le Pen, claims a global elite is conspiring against the European white populations and culture. His views on “the great replacement” have been translated by far-right websites and used to reinforce the thesis that there is a “white genocide” at work. That fear is also visible in Thilo Sarrazin’s 2010 book Germany Abolishes Itself, which topped German bestseller lists for 21 weeks and sold 1.5m copies. Sarrazin believes Muslim immigrants are less intelligent than Germans. Emboldened by his remarks, rightwing activists in Germany demand IQ tests for immigrants. In 2018 Sarrazin published Hostile Takeover, on more or less the same themes. This time, the political atmosphere has been even more welcoming with the far-right Alternative for Germany having entered parliament. In an interview, when asked whether he had anything positive to say about Islam, Sarrazin responded: “No, I believe the world would have been a better place if Islam had never existed.” The new radical right rhetoric deftly blends antisemitism and Islamophobia – but other forms of prejudice also share centre stage. Anti-feminism and gender bias echo throughout the works of the Canadian clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson. Packaging age-old reactionary machismo with sophisticated, academic language, he is the perfect intellectual icon for young, discontented men involved in the radical right. Peterson enjoys making grandiose claims and then watching people get upset. He is difficult to categorise, and that elusiveness is clearly cultivated. He walks an increasingly thin line between a scholar who rightly defends freedom of speech, and a demagogue who fuels discrimination. One wonders if this does not bother his conscience. When we think of white supremacists, we often think of uneducated, unemployed young men who spend entire days behind computer screens, individuals so disconnected and atomised they search desperately for a sense of safety and security in the dark labyrinths of the internet. We think of Charlottesville, of angry men marching with flaming torches in their hands. But these images are limited, and they fail to capture the extent of the cultural shift we are undergoing today. To understand that, we need to focus on the seismic changes in the publishing industry. There is a new radical-right intelligentsia and they provide the missing link between the world of art and the margins, they give legitimacy to reactionary politics and to the backlash against progressive reforms; they systematically distort facts, unashamedly rewrite history, and use their words and social status to incite hostility and separation. And they manage to do all of this with a shiny veneer of intellectual sophistication. • Elif Shafak is a novelist and political scientist",Opinion
"'Like the Eye of Sauron': western Europe’s tallest building planned for tiny Danish town Until a local company announced plans to send a 320-metre skyscraper soaring over the surrounding countryside, most people in Denmark had only the haziest idea where Brande, a town of 7,000 people in rural Jutland, even was. The Bestseller Tower, designed by star architectural studio Dorte Mandrup, will not only be the tallest building in Denmark, but the tallest in western Europe, besting the Shard in London by a crucial 10.4 metres. “It will be a landmark that places Brande on the map,” said Anders Krogh Vogdrup, head of constructions for Bestseller, after the local council voted the project through last month. Founded in the town back in 1975, fast-fashion giant Bestseller has reached far beyond its local origins. Its owner, Anders Holch Povlsen, is Denmark’s richest man and, like it or not, its brands Vero Modo and Jack and Jones are everywhere. “For more than 30 years, we have been very happy to have our home in Brande, and we feel we are a natural part of the local community,” Krogh Vogdrup said when the tower was first announced. The idea, he explained, is “to give something back to the town”. It won’t be the first rural skyscraper. At the height of Japan’s property bubble back in 1991, a 41-story residential tower, Sky Tower 41, was erected among fields. But in Jutland, the surrounding landscape is so flat that the tower will be visible from 60km away. Visitors to Jelling, the royal seat of Harald Bluetooth, the Viking king who united Denmark, will see its slender form jutting up from the horizon, as will visitors to Legoland 30km away. “It’s hard to find anybody here who is opposed to the tower. Everybody thinks it’s a fantastic idea, and me too,” says Morten Dickmann, a reporter for the local newspaper. “The Danish news media tried hard to find someone opposed, but they couldn’t find anyone.” In fact, opposition has come from people in Copenhagen, where Rokokoposten, Denmark’s answer to The Onion, wrote a spoof likening it to the sinister Tower of Sauron from Lord of the Rings. “I have offered to finance a major interactive art installation in the form of a blazing eye at the very top of the building,” it quoted the necromancer as saying. Trine Kammer, an architect who lives in Aarhus, but whose boyfriend grew up near Brande, complains that the local paper refuses to publish her objections. “People in Brande are so afraid to criticise Bestseller. It’s like a religion or something,” she says. She believes the building will destroy the feeling of “a huge, undisturbed landscape”. “Such a big building will make the world claustrophobically small. Why do I have to be reminded of Bestseller when I’m walking by myself in a quiet wood?” But locally, even Anders Udengaard, a Socialist Left party politician and longstanding critic of Bestseller, is grudgingly in favour. “There really is no opposition,” he says. “But for most people looking at a project like this being built in a community as small as this is, it does seem rather insane, doesn’t it?” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",Cities
"Mrs Brown's Boys D'Musical? review – where are d'jokes and d'good songs? Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Musical? begins where Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie left off, and, after two hours of weak gags and weaker songs, Mrs Brown’s Boys d’audience – or this member at least – is certain it ought to have spent longer in d’rehearsal room. As in the film, Dublin’s stout-hearted stallholders have won their court case against developers who wished to close Moore Street market. But where to find the €75,000 legal costs? Mrs Brown (Brendan O’Carroll), matriarch of the fruit stall, has a plum idea: put on a musical and watch the dosh roll in. The question mark of the title indicates a certain hesitancy over genre. There are only eight songs and they are, without exception, unmemorable. This is a mercy. The memory deserves better. As for O’Carroll’s script, well, if you took out all the effing and jeffing it would be a good deal shorter. The city of Billy Connolly needs no lessons in how swearing can add rhythm and oomph to a joke, but the trouble here is that too often the swearing is the joke. What niggles is the wasted opportunity. Mrs Brown’s Boys has long had an appreciative audience in Glasgow, going back to 2006 when it was spotted at the Pavilion theatre by a BBC producer who had a hunch it would make a sitcom. There is, therefore, a huge amount of goodwill in the room, much of it squandered. And the room itself – an arena – is too large. Unless you are sitting in the first 20 or so rows, you will likely find yourself watching the big screens rather than the stage. One positive: O’Carroll, as Mrs Brown, all cuppas and cardies and Les Dawson-ish gurn, is a pleasure to watch. More Teabag than Fleabag, his breaking of the fourth wall is always fun. He seems to forget his lines a few times, and even has to wander off set for a prompt, yet such lapses are in keeping with the franchise’s wonky, blooper-reel charm. Some pathos, much filth, these seem to be the ingredients for commercial success. Creatively, though? D’Musical is a dud. No question. • At Newcastle Arena, 5-7 April.

"Petitions and jokes will not halt this march into Brexit calamity It could conceivably have happened on any day over the past couple of years, but my own peak of anger about Brexit and its absurdities arrived last Wednesday. Jacob Rees-Mogg was in the Commons chamber, making quips about the fact that another Conservative MP had been to Winchester rather than Eton (“My honourable friend makes a characteristically Wykehamist point – highly intelligent, but fundamentally wrong” – how we all laughed). My mind’s eye was still switching back to the spectacle of Iain Duncan Smith arriving at Chequers in an open-topped vintage sports car. Meanwhile, there were reports of Theresa May’s address to Conservative MPs being made all the more dramatic by the sound of her voice cracking: something conspicuously absent when she has talked about everything from the Grenfell Tower disaster to her role in the Windrush tragedy, but there we are. In the classic sense of a very modern word, we are being trolled. Yet the outward mood of many people opposed to Brexit remains subdued, weary and fatalistic. As austerity grinds on and the social fabric carries on fraying, the impossibility of leaving the EU without truly dire economic and social damage is self-evident. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and – no, really – Dominic Raab are jostling to get the keys to 10 Downing Street. Our system of government has creaked to a halt; the official opposition is divided, confused and often mute. Anger might seem like the most apposite response, but what we have mostly seen is a strange passivity. Even on the march for a second referendum a week ago, the now-customary humour captured on the placards and banners too often seemed to capture a certain weariness, and the expectation of defeat: “If EU leave me now, EU’ll take away the biggest part of me”; “Think about the halloumi prices”; “I’m not one to make a fuss but the past couple of years have been, quite frankly, farcical”. By the time I came upon an ad hoc sound system blaring out Kool &amp; The Gang’s Celebration in Trafalgar Square, the dissonances had become too much to bear. I was in a party of five, and we all awkwardly joined in. But why? What was there to celebrate? How exactly were we actually meant to feel? The answers, perhaps, lay in the fact that we were in England. Undoubtedly, there was a certain fury in many people’s minds, but the carapace of irony and self-deprecation that obscured it brought to mind one of the ingrained aspects of national identity pointed out by the social anthropologist Kate Fox. In her classic book Watching the English, she writes about the deep layers of performance and self-mockery that smother even heartfelt misery and anger: “Even if you are feeling desperate, you must pretend to be only pretending to feel desperate.” More generally, she talks about “perverse obliqueness”, “emotional constipation” and a “general inability to engage in a direct and straightforward fashion with other human beings”. This has political as well as personal manifestations. People have spent two years calling for a “people’s vote” when what they actually wanted was the cancellation of the whole thing. Pro-remain MPs and campaigners now fixate on Norway-plus, common market 2.0 and MVs 3 and 4, but too often avert their eyes from the deep questions of history, culture and what kind of country we are that ultimately define what this is all about. Perhaps the framing of an issue of almost unprecedented importance in terms of arcana shouldn’t be too much of a surprise. At the start of this whole saga, let us not forget, the official remain campaign could bring itself to say little more stirring about the prospect of leaving the EU than the warning that people would be “£38 a week” worse off and that house prices would fall by “10 to 18%”. And so it has gone on. Brexit demands to be debated in the most fundamental terms – but England being England, it is too often reduced to the political equivalent of small talk. That said, recent(ish) history has had no end of political causes that attracted an altogether more passionate response, from the struggle against the far-right upsurge of the late 1970s, through massed shows of support for CND and the miners’ strike, to the poll tax riot of 1990 – the last time that street-level politics forced a change of government policy, and an event I heard a few people muttering about on the people’s vote march. Thirty years on, we face the final completion of a Tory project started back then, and the recasting of Britain – or, rather England – as a crabby, racist, inward-looking hole, and to what response? Jokes, mutterings, clicks, sporadic Twitterstorms, but nothing remotely comparable. Some of the explanation lies in two missing actors in this drama: the Labour leadership – and, with one or two exceptions, big voices in what is left of the trade union movement. But there are also even bigger forces in play. Forty years of post-Thatcher individualism have done their work, so that protest is now not a matter of collective agency (in other words, “we can stop this”), but the kind of atomised conscience-salving I first glimpsed at the time of the Iraq war, with the appearance of that deathly slogan “Not in my name”. Moreover, in a world as over-mediated as ours, each day brings a different spectacle – a march, a parliamentary vote, some or other drama at the top – so simultaneously ubiquitous and short-lived that joining everything together and having any sense of clear meaning becomes all but impossible. Politics becomes fidgety; strategy is lost amid tactics. To take that down to brass tacks, even if six million signatures on the petition to revoke article 50 represents a creditable achievement, what should everyone do next? It is part of the tragedy of Brexit that the opportunists now pushing the country towards disaster have not only been better at making their case with big stories and emotional oomph, but have not been convincingly challenged on that terrain. Whether we are talking about Tory ultra-leavers, that indefatigable chancer Nigel Farage or the new English fascists among those who turned up last week in Parliament Square, the same basic point applies: claims of treason and betrayal – let alone their ludicrous readings of history – must be contested. Put another way, I am not sure that the best way to answer this grim coalition of wreckers is with irony and understatement, an obsession with parliamentary procedure, and platform lineups featuring Michael Heseltine. Going back four decades, there might be something in the example set by Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League, and a bold, popular, singularly un-English approach memorably summed up by one of its activists: “For a while we managed to create, in our noisy, messy, unconventional way, an emotional alternative to nationalism and patriotism, a celebration of a different kind of pride and solidarity.” Out in the everyday world, the ongoing Westminster drama feels like it only scratches the surface of what is actually going on. And so the mad riddle of these times goes on, complete with one key mystery: that as the country drifts and the government falls apart, even the people involved in anti-Brexit protest and dissent seem confused, and far too quiet – and by the time our passions finally start stirring, it is likely to be far, far too late. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist",Opinion
"Number of primary school children at referral units soars The number of primary school children in pupil referral units (PRU) in England has more than doubled since 2011, raising concerns that the surge in school exclusions is affecting even the youngest children in the education system. While the vast majority of PRUs are for students who have been excluded from secondary school, official government data has shown a sharp increase in children under the age of 11 being taught in PRUs. Eight years ago, 715 children aged between five and 10 were being educated in a PRU, but by 2018 the number had gone up to 1,572, Labour analysis of official government statistics has shown. The research also found that in 2018 there were 42 under-fives being taught in PRUs, including both part-time and full-time pupils, compared with five in 2011. Of those, 28 children are toddlers, aged two and under. Commenting on the research, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “It is deeply concerning to see such a vast increase in the number of very young children being taught in pupil referral units.” According to the latest Department for Education (DfE) figures, 62 year 1 children and 163 year 2s were in PRUs in 2018, rising to 454 in year 6, the final year of primary. The analysis will add to anxieties about the rising number of pupils being excluded from mainstream schools, the vast majority of whom will end up in PRUs and alternative provision (AP). The number of children permanently excluded from state primary, secondary and special schools in England increased by about 1,000 between 2016 and 2017. In total, 7,700 were expelled in 2017, which equates to more than 40 permanent exclusions a day during the 2016-17 school year, compared with a little over 35 a day the previous year. Just 1% of permanently excluded children go on to achieve five good GCSEs. Secondary schools accounted for more than four out of five permanent or temporary exclusions, according to DfE figures, with “permanent disruptive behaviour” accounting for the bulk of the increase. The number of pupils in PRUs or AP peaks in year 11 with 7,420 students, of which just over 5,000 are male. The rise in permanent exclusions for the last three years follows a period of a generally downward trend from 2006-07 until 2012-13, and has been rising again since then, although rates are still lower now than in 2006-07. While many PRUs and AP offer a good alternative for pupils who cannot cope in mainstream education, the provision is variable and there is concern that some schools are excluding too readily due to zero-tolerance behaviour policies or to boost their results. The influential education select committee of cross-party MPs, which conducted an inquiry into AP last year, reported that an increasing number of children are being unnecessarily excluded from schools and “abandoned” in AP, which too often fails to give them the education they need to thrive. The government has been conducting a review of school exclusions, led by Edward Timpson, which is due to report shortly, in response to mounting alarm about the rise in exclusions from mainstream schools. Rayner said: “For too long, the Tories have sat by idly as some of the most vulnerable young people in our country are falling between the gaps and even out of education altogether. “Through our National Education Service, Labour will reform the accountability system and give schools the resources they need to support all pupils.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “No matter the obstacles they may face or the backgrounds they’re from, we want our young people to receive an education that fosters ambition and a confidence in their abilities. “Pupil referral units exist to work with young people with more complex problems. The classes are often smaller, with more specialist teaching, and can offer the support and mentoring that vulnerable children need.”",Education
